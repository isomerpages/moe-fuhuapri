#### **P6 Parent Engagement Session 2**


PSLE is a useful checkpoint to gauge students' understanding of key concepts and academic strengths. This will help them to learn at a suitable pace when they progress to secondary school. The change to the PSLE scoring system is part of a series of efforts MOE has introduced in the recent years to reduce over emphasis on exam grades. These efforts include removing some of the School-Based Assessments, introduced and broadened the Direct School Admissions and removing the release of Top scorers and maximum and minimum PSLE results on results slips. All these are done to help parents and students refocus their energy on the value of learning and growth rather than PSLE results Itself. Ultimately PSLE is a placement examination to decide the curriculum in secondary school that best match the students' current abilities. Here are information shared during the Parent Engagement Session on New PSLE Scoring System and Direct School Admission (DSA).
