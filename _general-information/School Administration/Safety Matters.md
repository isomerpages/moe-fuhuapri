### **Road Safety**

The safety of our students coming to and leaving school is important. This message reiterates the road safety policies of the school:

  

 a.     Reduce vehicle speed and stay alert for pedestrians in the school zone. Speed limit within the school premises is no more than 15km/h.
 
   
 
 b. Let your child alight only at the designated drop-off point.
 
   
 
 c.     Be advised not to violate traffic rules by driving recklessly or making illegal manoeuvres
 
 such as turning into the school from the outer lane(s) of the road.
 
   
 
 d.     Do not horn indiscriminately.
 
   
 
 e.     Help your child alight from the car as quickly as possible.
 
   

 f.     Reinforce correct road safety behavior such as using the pedestrian crossing, and avoiding jaywalking or using a handphone while crossing.
 
   
 
 g.     Remind your children to practise the kerb drill before crossing - “look right, look left, look right again, ensure all vehicles have stopped, raise your hand high up and cross the road briskly”.
 
   
 
 h.    If your child must cycle to school, ensure that he/she knows safe cycling rules and is a competent cyclist.

### **Personal Medication** 

If your child requires the use of daily medication (such as, inhalers for asthma or insulin injections for diabetes) or assistive devices (such as, hearing aids), please ensure that your child is aware of how to use them and carries them with him / her daily. 

  

Please keep the form teacher informed of your child’s condition. 

  

Do note that school staff are not authorised to administer any medication to students. 

  

### **Food Safety**

If your child has a food allergy, please inform his / her form teacher via email. Please share the doctor’s diagnosis as well as the safety plan for your child, in the event of an allergic reaction. 

  

### **Injuries Sustained in School**

If your child is injured in school, we will assess the extent of the injury before administering basic first aid. 

  

If your child needs further medical attention, you will be informed to pick up your child to be brought to the doctor. 

  

If urgent medical attention is required, we will bring your child to the nearest medical clinic or call for an ambulance and inform you.
