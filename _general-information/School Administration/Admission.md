### **Leave of Absence (LOA) Scheme**

The LOA scheme allows your child to rejoin their school after they return from overseas.

If your child is granted LOA, they will remain as a registered student of the school. They can then be re-admitted to the school directly after returning to Singapore.

The school will provide support in the following areas to ease your child's return: 

     

* **Administrative**: Renewal of LOA, returning arrangements, updates on important dates for admissions exercises, etc.

* **Academic**: Resources, information and support via the [Student Learning Space (SLS)](https://www.moe.gov.sg/education-in-sg/student-learning-space) portal that enables your child to keep up-to-date with our national curriculum.

* **Relationship**: Developments in the school and local education scene.

**Eligibility**

To be granted LOA, your child must fulfil all 3 of the following criteria:

*   An SC or PR.
*   Presently studying in a Singapore school.
*   Accompanying you on an overseas posting with the intention of rejoining their school after returning to Singapore.

Your child also qualifies for LOA if they are already registered for Primary 1 (P1) but will be overseas at the start of the year.

**Fees**

Schools will charge an annual nominal fee for a child on LOA. The amount will be determined by individual schools.

**How to apply**

Follow these steps to apply for LOA:

1\. Complete and submit an [application form](https://form.gov.sg/6360d00440fcd300125f7d91).  
2\. LOA application is subject to the Principal’s approval, and the school will notify you of the outcome.  
3\. Upon approval, the school will inform you of the amount payable. Enclose a cheque made payable to the school or make a cash payment at the school. Please do not send cash by post.  Alternative payment mode may be provided upon request, please email us at [fhps@moe.edu.sg](mailto:fhps@moe.edu.sg).      
4\. Renew LOA in **November** each year by submitting the renewal application form together with the required payment.  Your child’s LOA status will expire if you choose not to renew.
