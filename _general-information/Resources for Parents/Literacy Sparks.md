<p>At Fuhua Primary School, we're committed to nurturing language learners
who are not just proficient, but empathetic communicators, critical readers,
and creative inquirers. Our programmes blend the national English Language
curriculum with our school-based approach, meticulously crafted to meet
the objectives of the English Language Syllabus 2020 by the Ministry of
Education (MOE). With a strong emphasis on developing language skills,
fostering enjoyment in learning, and promoting extensive reading, we create
an environment where students thrive. Join us in empowering young minds
to become articulate, thoughtful, and versatile communicators, as we embrace
a dynamic school-based curriculum that transcends traditional boundaries
and prepares students for the challenges of the 21st century.</p>
