##### **WE STories – Getting to Know West Zone Secondary Schools**


Dear Parents/Guardians,

  

Congratulations on your child/ward’s completion of PSLE! Your child/ward is now on the cusp of a new education milestone. There are many new learning experiences that await them in secondary school. To enable you to guide your child/ward towards choosing schools that can cater to his/her interests and strengths, the secondary schools in the West Zone have put together WE STories. 

  

WE STories is a collection of stories from all the secondary schools in the West Zone. You will find within a map that shows schools in their geographical location with links that lead you directly to the respective school’s stories. Information on the schools’ talent areas for Direct School Admission (DSA), Applied Learning Programmes (ALP) and Learning for Life Programmes (LLP) are also consolidated for easy referencing. You can also click on the links provided by the respective schools to view interesting videos and artefacts that showcase each school’s distinctiveness.

  

We hope you could make use of this resource to make an informed school choice together with your child/ward.
