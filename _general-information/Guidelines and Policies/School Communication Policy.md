<h3>Parent - School Communication</h3>
<p>The school places premium on the close partnership with parents in supporting
our students in their learning and development. Bearing that in mind and
balancing it with the well-being of FHPS staff (teaching, non-teaching
staff and school leaders), the following will be the terms of our communication
policy:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Communication and engagement with staff to be kept within school hours
from 7.00 a.m. – 5.00 p.m. during the school terms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The modes of communication will be limited to :</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Email</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Message in the student’s organizer</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Message left with staff at the General Office</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>Appointments for face-to-face meetings with staff should be made at least
3 days&nbsp;in advance to avoid disappointments and minimise disruption
to their schedule.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a general guide to response time to ensure that queries are well-addressed,
we will follow the guidelines below:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">

</li>
<li>
<p>7 working days (query requires some investigation)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>21 working days (query with complexities)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ol start="5" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The school reserves the right not to engage with any parent who is disrespectful,
rude and abusive to our staff.</p>
</li>
</ol>
