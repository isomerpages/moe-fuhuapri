### Parent - School Communication

The school places premium on the close partnership with parents in supporting our students in their learning and development. Bearing that in mind and balancing it with the well-being of FHPS staff (teaching, non-teaching staff and school leaders), the following will be the terms of our communication policy:

  

1. Communication and engagement with staff to be kept within school hours from

 7.00 a.m. – 5.30 p.m. during the school terms.

  

2. The modes of communication will be limited to :

 a. Email
 
 b. Message in the student’s organizer
 
 c. Message left with staff at the General Office

  

3. Appointments for face-to-face meetings with staff should be made at least 3 days in advance to avoid disappointments and minimize disruption to their schedule.

  

4. As a general guide to response time to ensure that queries are well-addressed, we will follow the guidelines below:

 a. 3 working days (general query)

 b. 7 working days (query requires some investigation)
 
 c. 21 working days (query with complexities)

  

5. The school reserves the right not to engage with any parent who is disrespectful, rude and abusive to our staff.
