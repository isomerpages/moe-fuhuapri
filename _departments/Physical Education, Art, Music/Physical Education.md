<h4><strong>PURPOSE of PE</strong></h4>
<p>Physical Education is an integral component of Singapore’s school curriculum
to develop students holistically. By emphasising the importance of movement
and an individual’s interaction with the environment, Physical Education
seeks to develop physically competent and confident individuals who enjoy
a lifetime of active and healthy living safely and responsibly. At the
primary school level, we aim to nurture students into competent participants
who demonstrate efficiency, effectiveness and versatility in movement competencies.</p>
<p><strong>After going through 6 years of Physical Education in Fuhua Primary School, each Fuhua GEM would acquire:</strong> 
<br>Goal 1: <strong>Movement Competence.</strong> Students are competent and
confident to participate in a range of physical and outdoor activities.
<br>Goal 2: <strong>Healthy Lifestyle Practices.</strong> Students have a personal
commitment to healthy lifestyle practices in physical activity, nutrition,
sleep, outdoor time and hygiene.
<br>Goal 3: <strong>Safety Mindset.</strong> Students apply risk assessment
to manage daily and physical activities with respect to self, others and
the environment.
<br>Goal 4: <strong>Core Values.</strong> Students make informed and responsible
decisions with regard to personal behaviour and social interactions based
on sound values-based judgements.
<br>Goal 5: <strong>Enjoyment.</strong> Students enjoy and value physical activities
and healthy living in a sustainable way.</p>
<p>The learning experiences leading to the goals of Physical Education at
the primary level are organised according to the three learning areas and
content areas/strands as shown in the table below:</p>

<p>In Fuhua Primary School, our PE curriculum is designed in a spiral approach,
serving to promotes the ideals of a LIFE-LONG LEARNER. This approach seeks
to reinforce the skills and knowledge taught within the learning year and
across their six years in school. We believe that this approach provides
a holistic learning experience for our pupils as they develop an enjoyment
towards physical activity and strive to be active during adulthood.</p>
<p>Our PE curriculum also include our pupils going through fun and engaging
PE programmes that allow our pupils to apply their skills and knowledge
learned from their PE lessons. These programmes are ideal platforms for
our students to display the intended CCE learning outcomes and 21st century
competencies. We believe that these learning experiences are important
as our pupils gain awareness and seek to develop themselves into a responsible
CITIZEN LEADER. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Digital connectivity has accelerated and shape new ways of living and
learning. In our quest towards nurturing our pupils into TECH – SAVVY INNOVATORS,
we strive to infuse ICT based lessons into our curriculum. Pupils will
be able to harness ICT skills such as video-recording to analyse physical
performance and provide valuable feedback to facilitate learning and enhance
performance.</p>
<p>Please refer to the table below on the various PE programs to enhance
the overall PE experience in Fuhua Primary School.</p>

further reinforces the importance of shared experiences and promotes healthy
habits within their social circles.</p>
