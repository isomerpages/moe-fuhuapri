We aim to help our students appreciate the beauty of Mathematics and understand the role of the discipline in our world. 

  

Problem-solving is central to the Mathematics curriculum. Students must acquire and develop the joy of problem-solving in order for them to sustain their interest in the discipline. Our curriculum is designed to help our students achieve a high level of mastery that will excite and serve them well in life. 

  

#### **APPROACHES**


The Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract (C-P-A) approach is an essential technique in the mastery of Mathematics that builds on students’ existing understanding progressively. It involves the use of  concrete materials and pictorial/representation diagrams in authentic contexts to strengthen conceptual understanding.

  

We recognise that assessment is an integral part of learning. Assessment provides us with important information such as the level of mastery students have attained, effectiveness of pedagogies used in the classrooms, learning gaps etc. To get a more holistic view of the teaching process, we have added the assessment component to the C-P-A approach. In Fuhua Primary, we use the C-P-A + A approach where assessment data is used consistently to guide us in planning and implementing the lessons.

  

In line with our C-P-A + A approach, we have developed a rigorous assessment plan, incorporating Performance Tasks (open-ended, process-oriented, authentic tasks with no fixed solutions) and Performance Based Assessments (hands-on tasks that assess students' conceptual understanding) from Primary 1 to Primary 6.

  

In our UbD lessons design, the focus is on the skills acquired by the students. For a start, we create opportunities for students to transfer the skills learnt in one topic to other topics within the Mathematics curriculum. Progressively, students would be able to transfer the skills learnt to other subjects and eventually students would be able to transfer the skills learnt across different subjects and domains.

In the lower primary year, it is essential that students build their foundation in Mathematics, particularly in terms of factual and procedural fluency. This allows teachers to build on their foundation and extend their learning as students move up to Primary 6. 

  

Application, Reasoning and Communication skills are transdisciplinary skills that cut across not just the Mathematics curriculum but also other curriculae as we continue in our journey to help prepare our students for the 21st century. 

  

Our school-based Mathematics materials echo the importance of the strong foundation as well as the ability to apply, reason and communicate. Our worksheets are divided into three sections:

*   Factual and Procedural Fluency
*   Heuristics (Application & Reasoning)
*   Reasoning & Communication
