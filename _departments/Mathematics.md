<p>We aim to help our students appreciate the beauty of Mathematics and understand
the role of the discipline in our world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Problem solving is central to the Mathematics curriculum. Students must
acquire and develop the joy of problem solving in order for them to sustain
their interest in the discipline. Our curriculum is designed to help our
students achieve a high level of mastery that will excite and serve them
well in life.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Nurturing Problem Solvers through Math Curriculum</strong></h4>

<h4><strong>APPROACHES</strong></h4>
<p>The Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract (C-P-A) approach is an essential technique
in the mastery of Mathematics that builds on students’ existing understanding
progressively. It involves the use of concrete materials and pictorial/
representation and diagrams in authentic contexts to strengthen conceptual
understanding.</p>
<p>We recognise that assessment is an integral part of learning. Assessment
provides us with important information such as the level of mastery students
have attained, effectiveness of pedagogies used in the classrooms and students’
learning deficiencies. To get a more holistic view of the teaching process,
we have added the assessment component to the C-P-A approach. In Fuhua
Primary, we use assessment data consistently to guide us in planning and
implementing effective lessons.</p>
<p>In line with our emphasis on CPA and assessment, we have developed a rigorous
assessment plan, incorporating Performance Tasks (open-ended, process oriented,
authentic tasks with no fixed solutions) and Performance Based Assessments
(hands on tasks that assess students' conceptual understanding) from Primary
1 to Primary 6.</p>
<p>In our lesson design guided by the Understand by Design (UbD) curriculum
framework, the focus is on the skills acquired by the students, particularly
the 21st CC such as collaboration, communication, critical thinking and
creativity (4Cs). For a start, we create opportunities for students to
practise and demonstrate the 4Cs within the subjects and topics they learn.
Progressively, students would be given projects and tasks where they would
transfer the skills learnt in authentic situations.</p>
<h4><strong>LEARNING MILESTONES</strong></h4>
<p>Application, Reasoning and Communication skills are transdisciplinary
skills that cut across not just the Mathematics curriculum but also other
curriculums as we continue in our journey to help prepare our students
for the 21st century.</p>

<p>In the lower primary year, it is essential that students build their foundation
in Mathematics, particularly in terms of factual and procedural fluency.
This allows teachers to build on their foundation and extend their learning
as students move up to the upper primary levels.</p>
