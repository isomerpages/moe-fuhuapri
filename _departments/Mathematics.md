We aim to help our students appreciate the beauty of Mathematics and understand the role of the discipline in our world. 

  

Problem-solving is central to the Mathematics curriculum. Students must acquire and develop the joy of problem-solving in order for them to sustain their interest in the discipline. Our curriculum is designed to help our students achieve a high level of mastery that will excite and serve them well in life. 

  

#### **APPROACHES**

The Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract (C-P-A) approach is an essential technique in the mastery of Mathematics that builds on students’ existing understanding progressively. It involves the use of concrete materials and pictorial/ representation and diagrams in authentic contexts to strengthen conceptual understanding.

We recognise that assessment is an integral part of learning. Assessment provides us with important information such as the level of mastery students have attained, effectiveness of pedagogies used in the classrooms and students’ learning deficiencies. To get a more holistic view of the teaching process, we have added the assessment component to the C-P-A approach. In Fuhua Primary, we use assessment data consistently to guide us in planning and implementing effective lessons.

In line with our emphasis on CPA and assessment, we have developed a rigorous assessment plan, incorporating Performance Tasks (open-ended, process oriented, authentic tasks with no fixed solutions) and Performance Based Assessments (hands on tasks that assess students' conceptual understanding) from Primary 1 to Primary 6.

In our lesson design guided by the Understand by Design (UbD) curriculum framework, the focus is on the skills acquired by the students, particularly the 21st CC such as collaboration, communication, critical thinking and creativity (4Cs).  For a start, we create opportunities for students to practise and demonstrate the 4Cs within the subjects and topics they learn. Progressively, students would be given projects and tasks where they would transfer the skills learnt in authentic situations.


  

#### **LEARNING MILESTONES**

Application, Reasoning and Communication skills are transdisciplinary skills that cut across not just the Mathematics curriculum but also other curriculums as we continue in our journey to help prepare our students for the 21st century.

In the lower primary year, it is essential that students build their foundation in Mathematics, particularly in terms of factual and procedural fluency. This allows teachers to build on their foundation and extend their learning as students move up to the upper primary levels.
