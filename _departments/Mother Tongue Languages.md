The Mother Tongue Language (MTL) Department offers the following languages in our school:
<br>•	Chinese Language
<br>•	Malay Language
<br>•	Tamil Language

The MTL department seeks to nurture active learners and proficient users of the Mother Tongue Language in an engaging learning environment. The department firmly believes in the importance of fostering students’ interest, appreciation and respect for our culture and traditions. The school aims to develop every student to be a competent and confident communicator of their Mother Tongue Language.

##### **MTL Curriculum**
The MTL curriculum in Fuhua Primary School integrates multiple learning experiences. Through these experiences, students gain knowledge and skills of their Mother Tongue Languages, share cross-cultural understanding, and acquire practical communication and collaborative skills. 
We focus on the functional use of Mother Tongue Languages, with greater emphasis on communication skills as the cornerstone of language proficiency. As students learn their Mother Tongue Language through our engaging curriculum, they will make connections to their daily life and interests through activities such asanimation, digital interactive games, and authentic language tasks. Students are also provided with opportunities to use their Mother Tongue Languages for creative production such asdigital book sharing and  Vlog.
Starting from 2022, Fuhua Primary School also offers Higher Mother Tongue Languages from Primary 3 students. This will allow more students to deepen their knowledge and appreciation for the languages and their cultures from an early age.

  

##### **ICT for Learning in the MTL Curriculum**

Fuhua Primary School is the Center of Excellence of ICT in Teaching and Learning. Students’ learning in MTL lessons are enriched with various digital resources via online platforms. With the online resources, students extend their learning beyond the classroom. Students are also able to revisit the learning content at their own pace.
