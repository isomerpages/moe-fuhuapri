Bilingual education is one of the cornerstones of Singapore’s education system. We strongly believe that learning MTLs will:  

*   enable our children to have a deeper appreciation of their own culture
*   communicate widely with people and gain broader perspectives

  

The 2015 MOE MTL new curriculum places greater emphasis on teaching and learning of spoken and written interaction skills. The MTL curriculum also includes authentic activities to develop them into proficient language users who communicate effectively and confidently. Through these activities, our students also learn about values and culture. The new curriculum also promotes the greater use of ICT to better engage our children in learning MTL.

  

We aim to develop proficient users and active learners of Mother Tongue Languages. In addition to adopting the strategies based on the 2015 syllabus, we have extended our students’ learning through various programmes and various ICT platforms. As our students progress from the lower to upper primary levels, they will be equipped with a set of useful strategies to be a lifelong learner, citizen leader as well as tech-savvy innovator.

  

##### **LESSON DESIGN MODEL- UNDERSTANDING BY DESIGN**


The school employs Understanding by Design (UbD) as our lesson design which plays a positive contribution to our teachers’ professional development process and students’ MTL achievement. UbD is utilised as a tool both for continuing teachers’ professional development and ensuring students’ enduring understanding. It facilitates students’ learning in a meaningful and enduring way. 

  

Thinking routines, differentiated instructions and different modes of assessment are incorporated in our school's curriculae to cater to students’ needs and create a positive and deeper learning experience. The integration of the above mentioned methods helps to establish an enjoyable learning atmosphere for students.
