appreciation and respect for our culture and traditions. The school aims
to develop every student to be a competent and confident communicator of
their Mother Tongue Language.</p>
<h5><strong>MTL Curriculum</strong></h5>
<p>The MTL curriculum in Fuhua Primary School integrates multiple learning
experiences. Through these experiences, students gain knowledge and skills
of their Mother Tongue Languages, share cross-cultural understanding, and
acquire practical communication and collaborative skills. We focus on the
functional use of Mother Tongue Languages, with greater emphasis on communication
skills as the cornerstone of language proficiency. As students learn their
Mother Tongue Language through our engaging curriculum, they will make
connections to their daily life and interests through activities such asanimation,
digital interactive games, and authentic language tasks. Students are also
provided with opportunities to use their Mother Tongue Languages for creative
production such asdigital book sharing and Vlog. Starting from 2022, Fuhua
Primary School also offers Higher Mother Tongue Languages from Primary
3 students. This will allow more students to deepen their knowledge and
appreciation for the languages and their cultures from an early age.</p>
