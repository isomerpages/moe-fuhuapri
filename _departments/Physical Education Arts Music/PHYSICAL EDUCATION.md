#### **PURPOSE**
The purpose of physical and health education is to enable students to demonstrate individually and with others, the physical skills, practices and values to enjoy a lifetime of active, healthy living. 
We seek to enable students to enjoy a lifetime of active and healthy living.


In 2014, a new 2014 PE syllabus was introduced using Learning Outcomes (LOs) to specify minimally what students should know and be able to do as a result of their learning. 

The Primary PE syllabus aims to develop competent movers who demonstrate efficiency, effectiveness and versatility in movement competencies. 

Seven learning areas are identified to facilitate these learning experiences in primary schools so as to attain the 6 goals of PE. 



**After going through 6 years of Physical Education in Fuhua Primary School, a child would:**
<br>Goal 1: Acquire a range of movement skills to participate in a variety of physical activities. 
<br>Goal 2: Understand and apply movement concepts, principles and strategies in a range of physical activities. 
<br>Goal 3: Demonstrate safe practices during physical and daily activities with respect to themselves, others and the environment. 
<br>Goal 4: Display positive personal and social behaviour across different experiences. <br>Goal 5: Acquire and maintain health-enhancing fitness through regular participation in physical activities. 
<br>Goal 6: Enjoy and value the benefits of living a physically active and healthy life.

Seven learning areas are identified to facilitate these learning experiences in primary schools so as to attain these 6 goals of PE. 

#### **SNIPPETS OF EXCITING PE PROGRAMMES IN FUHUA**


**1) Wholesome Week**

Greater awareness for healthy living is raised through inter-class challenges. Students learn to take responsibility in their food choices and learn about the emotional and physical advantages of being active and healthy.Â 

  

Students and teachers take part in daily challenges to score points for their classes. The Physical Challenge allows students to take part in physical activities in school while the Healthy Challenge allows students to display healthy eating habits in school and at home. The class with the most points accumulated will win the Wholesome Week Championship.
