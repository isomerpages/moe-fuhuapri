#### **PURPOSE of PE**

The purpose of physical and health education is to enable students to demonstrate individually and with others, the physical skills, practices and values to enjoy a lifetime of active, healthy living.&nbsp;We seek to enable students to enjoy a lifetime of active and healthy living.

In 2014, a new 2014 PE syllabus was introduced using Learning Outcomes (LOs) to specify minimally what students should know and be able to do as a result of their learning.

The Primary PE syllabus aims to develop competent movers who demonstrate efficiency, effectiveness and versatility in movement competencies.

Seven learning areas are identified to facilitate these learning experiences in primary schools so as to attain the 6 goals of PE.

**After going through 6 years of Physical Education in Fuhua Primary School, a child would:**
<br>Goal 1: Acquire a range of movement skills to participate in a variety of physical activities. 
<br>Goal 2: Understand and apply movement concepts, principles and strategies in a range of physical activities. 
<br>Goal 3: Demonstrate safe practices during physical and daily activities with respect to themselves, others and the environment. 
<br>Goal 4: Display positive personal and social behaviour across different experiences. 
<br>Goal 5: Acquire and maintain health-enhancing fitness through regular participation in physical activities. 
<br>Goal 6: Enjoy and value the benefits of living a physically active and healthy life.

Seven learning areas are identified to facilitate these learning experiences in primary schools so as to attain these 6 goals of PE. 

<br>**Learning Areas**
<br>1. Athletics (From Primary 3)
<br>2. Dance
<br>3. Games &amp; Sports
<br>4. Gymnastics
<br>5. Outdoor Education
<br>6. Physical Health and Fitness
<br>7. Swimming (By end of Primary 6)


In Fuhua Primary School, our PE curriculum is designed in a spiral approach, serving to promotes the ideals of a LIFE-LONG LEARNER. This approach seeks to reinforce the skills and knowledge taught within the learning year and across their six years in school. We believe that this approach provides a holistic learning experience for our pupils as they develop an enjoyment towards physical activity and strive to be active during adulthood.

Pupils are excited and confident to pick up new skills and knowledge, apply them during authentic situations. These situations further reinforce the CCE learning outcomes and 21st century competencies as our pupils gain awareness and seek to develop themselves into a CITIZEN LEADER.

Digital connectivity has accelerated and shape new ways of living and learning. In our quest towards nurturing our pupils into TECH – SAVVY INNOVATORS. We strive to infuse ICT based lessons into our curriculum. Pupils will be able to harness ICT skills such as video-recording to analyze physical performance and provide valuable feedback to improve learning and performance
