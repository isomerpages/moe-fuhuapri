#### **LEARNING OF MUSIC @ FUHUA**


  

Through the music education at Fuhua Primary School, students learn to express their feelings and thoughts and appreciate music in local and global cultures through student-centric programmes and activities. Fuhua leverages on technology to deepen students’ learning through creative music production and performance to develop critical thinking skills, psychomotor skills, social awareness, as well as moral and cultural values.

  

  

#### **EXPERIENCE-CONCEPT-APPLICATION**

  

The school adapts the Experience-Concept-Application Approach or ECA Music Approach from Singapore Teachers’ Academy for the Arts (STAR) to assist us in our lesson design.

Lessons begin by providing opportunities for students to experience the concept through rote learning(imitation and repetition).  Students’ curiosity is anticipated as they progress along the lesson.  

  

Moving on to the concept stage, the teacher engages the students with questions that will lead them to the discovery of the concept in musical terms.  For upper primary students, concepts are integrated with historical events and cultural backgrounds.  They are encouraged to be self-directed learners through independent research and exploration of variety of learning materials.  

  

**Music Programmes:**

  

**1) Lower Primary Keyboarding**

Primary 1 and Primary 2 students are introduced to the basic theory and notation of keyboard which build the foundation for future instrumental learning. They are also given opportunities to explore and create simple digital music such as, Song Maker from Chrome Music Lab and/or Creatability from Experiment with Google. 

  

**2) Middle Primary Ethnic Instrument Programme**

The students are introduced to Malay ethnic instruments and Indian percussion instruments in Primary 3 and Primary 4 respectively. This programme is aligned with MOE’s 21st century competencies and student outcomes, mainly civic literacy, global awareness and cross-cultural skills. The middle primary students will have the opportunity to showcase their learning in the form of digital music using the GarageBand music application as a platform.

  

**3) Upper Primary Contemporary Music Programme**

The Primary 5 and Primary 6 students create music through improvisation of lyrics and melody. They play ukulele as their main instrument in exhibiting their individual proficiency. They continue to build up a repertoire that includes classical, folk and popular songs from Singapore, the Americas and Europe.  The upper primary students also experience dancing to local ethnic and contemporary beats, play Latin drums and STOMP.

  

**4) Recess recitals**

The weekly virtual recess recitals celebrate students’ learning in music. Students are provided with an online platform to share their interests in the performing arts (singing/dancing/playing instrument) with other students in the school. This programme allows the students to appreciate the various forms of arts and express their creativity and uniqueness.
