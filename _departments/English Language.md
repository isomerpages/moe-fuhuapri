We aim to develop language learners to be empathetic communicators, critical readers and creative inquirers. Fuhua Primary uses both STELLAR (the national English Language curriculum) and our school-based curriculum to achieve the outcomes specified by MOE’s English Language Syllabus.

  

The STELLAR curriculum anchors on a whole-part-whole approach in which a selected text provides the context for learning of specific reading and comprehension skills, speaking and listening, grammar as well as vocabulary. The knowledge and skills are then applied in writing of different text types. 

  

The school-based curriculum enhances the learning through the specific application of thinking routines and concepts and then applying these routines across different units and related subjects. Authentic experiences are also key to deep learning of dispositions and skills. Learning experiences are carefully planned with the intention of integrating appropriate learning objectives across different subjects. For example, English Language, Outdoor Education and Mathematics skills are applied in the Primary 1 Learning journey to the Singapore Zoo. 

  

As the Centre of Excellence (COE) in ICT for Teaching and Learning and in line with the fast-changing English Language teaching and learning landscape, our curriculum will draw greater attention to Multi-literacies, Metacognition and Inquiry through Dialogue (MMI) to help students achieve the 21st Century Competencies across all areas of language learning.


#### **APPROACHES**


The school employs Understanding by Design (UbD) as a curriculum framework for lesson design. The framework guides our teachers in planning the curriculum that:

*   creates opportunities for application and
*   transference of skills and attitudes
*   strengthen their content mastery in the following areas:

*   listening and viewing
*   speaking and representing
*   reading and viewing
*   writing and representing
*   grammar
*   vocabulary

Thinking routines, differentiated instructions and different modes of assessment are incorporated to cater to students’ needs and create a positive and deeper learning experience.
