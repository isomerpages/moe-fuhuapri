<p>At Fuhua Primary school, we are dedicated to cultivating language learners
who are not only proficient but also empathetic communicators, critical
readers, and creative inquirers. At the heart of our pedagogical approach
lies a commitment to aligning with the national educational frameworks
and standards.</p>
<p>Our programs are designed to incorporate both the national English Language
curriculum, STELLAR, and our school-based curriculum. In particular, our
curriculum is meticulously crafted to meet the objectives outlined in the
English Language Syllabus 2020 for the Primary level, set forth by the
Ministry of Education (MOE).</p>
<p>The English Language Syllabus 2020 places a strong emphasis on the development,
reinforcement, and extension of language skills during the formative primary
years. We foster an environment that encourages students to derive enjoyment
from language learning, promoting extensive reading as a cornerstone of
linguistic enrichment. Moreover, we leverage oracy, reading, and writing
skills not only to build a strong linguistic foundation but also to nurture
independent use of the language.</p>
<p>As a department, we are enthusiastic about embracing these educational
guidelines to ensure that our students not only excel in English language
proficiency but also develop a genuine passion for language and literature.
Join us on this enriching journey as we empower young minds to become articulate,
thoughtful, and versatile communicators.</p>
<p>In the enriching tapestry of learning at Fuhua Primary School, our dynamic
school-based curriculum transcends traditional boundaries. By intricately
weaving thinking routines and concepts into our educational fabric, we
foster a unique approach that extends across diverse units and related
subjects. Authentic experiences take centre stage in our commitment to
deep learning, shaping not only knowledge but also cultivating essential
dispositions and skills. Our meticulously planned learning experiences
are designed with the deliberate intent of seamlessly integrating learning
objectives across various subjects.</p>
<p>Our Primary 1 Learning journey to the Singapore Zoo, where the fusion
of English Language, Outdoor Education, and Mathematics skills creates
a vibrant and holistic educational adventure. Join us on a journey where
education is a rich tapestry of experiences, seamlessly blending disciplines
and skills to nurture well-rounded and engaged learners.</p>
<p>As the Centre of Excellence (COE) in ICT for Teaching and Learning, in
response to the rapidly evolving landscape of English Language teaching
and learning, our curriculum is centred on the pillars of Multi-literacies,
Metacognition, and Inquiry through Dialogue (MMI) and we are dedicated
to guiding students towards mastering 21st Century Competencies across
all facets of language learning.</p>
<p>Embracing these transformative elements, our curriculum not only imparts
language proficiency but also cultivates critical thinking, self-awareness,
and an inquisitive spirit. Join us on a journey where education transcends
traditional boundaries, preparing students to thrive in the dynamic challenges
of the 21st century.</p>

<h5>P1, P2 Drama Programme</h5>
<p>Expression, voice, movement, creativity, character…there is so much to
drama! As part of our continuous efforts to develop confident and empathetic
communicators, our P1 and students went through a drama programme over
seven sessions, culminating in a well-received performance. The drama enrichment
programme aims to empower students to become confident and effective communicators
who can interact with a wide range of audiences.</p>

<p>Our students benefit from a “hands-on,” experiential approach that applauds
their ability to appraise situations and explore new scenarios with confidence
and verve, &nbsp;encouraging their enjoyment and appreciation of the value
of drama.</p>

<p>Students’ collaboration with one another also resulted in individual and
group contributions towards shared goals of meaningfully conveying the
intended messages to the audience. In an environment that is loving and
flexible, never critical or pressurizing, we see how much they have blossomed
since the start of the programme.</p>
