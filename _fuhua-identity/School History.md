<h3><strong>Fuhua Primary School: A Legacy of Excellence</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>The Beginnings</strong></h4>
<p>Established on 18 July 1941, Fuhua Primary School began as a humble village
school along Upper Jurong Road, near the present-day Nanyang Technological
University. Then known as Fu Hua Public School, it was founded by a group
of public-spirited villagers who were driven by a shared vision—to provide
quality education for the children in their community.</p>

<p>In the late 1960s, the school became a government-aided institution, and
in 1984, it relocated to its current premises at Jurong East Street 13
to make way for urban development. It officially became a full government
school, and its new campus was formally opened in 1986 by the then Member
of Parliament for Jurong, Mr Ho Kah Leong.</p>

<p>A unique aspect of the school’s identity lies in its distinctive uniform—designed
from a Japanese fashion magazine and personally selected by former principal
Mr Billy Goh.</p>
<h4><strong>Milestones of Growth</strong></h4>
<p>Between 2002 and 2003, Fuhua underwent the PRIME upgrading programme,
enhancing its infrastructure to meet modern educational needs. The upgraded
facilities were officially opened on 20 November 2004.</p>

<p>In 2008, Fuhua Primary School merged with Pandan Primary School, retaining
the Fuhua name and current campus location, further strengthening its legacy
as a trusted and established institution in the community.</p>

<h4><strong>Recognition and Achievements</strong></h4>
<p>Fuhua’s commitment to environmental education has garnered national and
regional recognition. In 2012, the school was awarded the ASEAN Eco-School
Award, and in 2013, it became the first primary school in Singapore to
receive the President’s Award for the Environment—the nation’s highest
environmental accolade.</p>

<p>That same year, Fuhua was also designated the West Zone Centre of Excellence
(CoE) for ICT in Teaching and Learning. This affirmed the school’s leadership
in the innovative use of technology to enhance teaching and learning, as
well as its contributions to building capacity in schools across the West
Zone.</p>
<h4><strong>Nurturing Grateful, Future-Ready Learners</strong></h4>
<p>Guided by the enduring philosophy of our founders, "Ying Shui Shu Yuan"—to
be grateful, to remember our roots, and to give back—we nurture students
who are not only academically confident but also grounded in strong values,
character, and compassion.</p>
<p>At Fuhua, we provide rich and varied learning experiences that prepare
our students, affectionately known as Fuhua Gems, to thrive in a rapidly
changing world. Leveraging our strengths in environmental education and
educational technology, we design authentic, hands-on experiences that
build essential 21st-century competencies.</p>
<p>Fuhua is more than just a school—it is a vibrant and caring community.
We actively encourage collaboration and involvement from parents and partners,
recognising that our collective efforts shape the holistic development
of every child.</p>
<p>Together, we continue to grow a community that learns with purpose, leads
with heart, and serves with gratitude.</p>
