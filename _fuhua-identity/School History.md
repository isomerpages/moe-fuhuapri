<h3><strong>The Beginnings</strong></h3>
<p>Fuhua was established on 18 July 1941. &nbsp;It has its humble beginnings
as a village school which was originally situated at Upper Jurong Road
in the vicinity of the present Nanyang Technological University.</p>

<p>Known originally as Fu Hua Public School, it was built by a group of public-spirited
villagers who were determined to provide the best education for their young.</p>

<p>Fuhua became a government-aided school in the late 1960s. &nbsp;The school
was relocated at its present site in 1984 to make way for development and
has since become a government school.</p>

of Parliament for Jurong, Mr Ho Kah Leong.</p>

<p>Interesting Fact: Do you know why our uniform is so special? One of our
previous principals, Mr Billy Goh, chose the design of the school uniform
from a Japanese fashion magazine.</p>

<p>The school underwent PRIME between 2002 and 2003 and the new building
was officially opened on 20 November 2004.</p>
<p>In January 2008, Fuhua Primary School and Pandan Primary School merged.
The merged school remained at the Jurong East St 13 premises and the name
of Fuhua Primary School was retained.</p>

<p>Fuhua Primary resides in a quiet neighbourhood along Jurong East St 13.
Though sporting a new and modern facade, the school has a rich history
that spans over 80 years. The school's survival as an institution was only
possible through the tenacious spirit of the school's founding members
who believed that education was the primary means through which their children
could move up the social strata and lead more comfortable lives.</p>
<p>In 2010, Fuhua Primary School re-applied for the Programmes for School
Excellence(PSE) and was awarded PSE/ICT for the following three years.
The school continues to spearhead in the area of innovative teaching and
learning with technology.</p>
<p>Fuhua Primary School attained the People's Developer Standard (PDS), the
MOE National Education (Development Award) as well as the prestigious PUB
Watermark Award &nbsp;for the school's efforts in Environmental Education
and Water Conservation in 2011.</p>

<p>In February 2013, Fuhua Primary School was designated the West Zone Centre
of Excellence for ICT in Teaching and Learning. A recognition for the school's
capacity in using technology innovatively to enhance teaching and learning,
as well as contributions to the West Zone schools in the area of harnessing
technology for student learning, equipping them with the&nbsp; 21st Century
skillsets. As the Centre of Excellence in the area of ICT for the West
Zone, the school will take the lead to share and work with West Zone schools
in building the capacity of teachers and schools in harnessing technology
for learning.</p>
<p>In the same year, Fuhua Primary School was presented with the highest
accolade for environmental awards - President Award for the Environment
(PAE). The school is also the first primary school to receive this prestigious
award.</p>
<p>Fuhua Primary School is widely recognised for its sustained passion and
dedication to environmental education. The school operates a wide spectrum
of well-structured and comprehensive environment-related programmes for
staff and students alike. Environmental messages, which promote water conservation,
waste minimisation and biodiversity preservation, are well-infused into
the school curriculum, and communicated in a lively way to the students.</p>
<p>In addition, the school has cultivated strategic partnerships in ICT and
EE. In 2016, the school underwent an External Validation Exercise and was
recognised for Best Practice in Partnership&nbsp;by MOE.&nbsp;A wide range
of partners in critical areas supports the school programmes&nbsp;and initiatives
in ICT and EE, bringing new opportunities for staff and student learning.
In&nbsp;the area of ICT, its role as West Zone Centre of Excellence (WZ
COE) for ICT in T&amp;L in 2013 and ALP status in Coding in 2016 have afforded&nbsp;opportunities
to work with multiple partners including IDA, NIE and MOE ETD.&nbsp;In
the area of EE, partnerships with Pacific Light Energy and Canon Singapore
have enabled scholarships for FHPS Environmental Ambassadors and the organisation
of the National Primary School Photography Competition since 2011 while
sustained partnership with Yuhua CC supports its CIP/VIA programme.</p>
<p>Fuhua Primary School was awarded the BCA Green Mark GoldPLUS in 2019 as
a affirmation for the environmental efforts Fuhua Primary School had embarked
for the past few years.&nbsp;The Green Mark certification scheme was launched
in January 2005. It is a green building rating system designed to evaluate
a buildingâ€™s environmental impact and performance. It provides a comprehensive
framework for assessing the overall environmental performance of new and
existing buildings to promote sustainable design, and best practices in
construction and operations in buildings.&nbsp;Our Subject Head for Environmental
Education, Mrs Shirley Koh, was conferred the NEA Eco Friend Award in 2018
as a recognition for the environmental programmes and outreaches.</p>
<p>Fuhua Primary School celebrated its 80th Anniversary in 2021.</p>
