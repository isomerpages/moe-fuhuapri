<p><strong>Welcome to Fuhua Primary School!</strong>
</p>
<p>Warm greetings! I am honoured to lead a community of passionate educators,
enthusiastic learners, and supportive parents committed to excellence.
The year <strong>2026</strong> is especially significant as we celebrate <strong>Fuhua Primary School’s 85th anniversary</strong>.
For more than eight decades, Fuhua has been moulding lives, nurturing character,
and <strong>uplifting generations through purpose and impact</strong>.</p>
<p>At Fuhua, <strong>our commitment</strong> is to develop the whole child—lifelong
learners, citizen leaders, and tech-savvy innovators ready to thrive in
an ever-changing world. Our curriculum equips students with essential 21st-century
skills such as adaptability, critical thinking, communication, and collaboration.</p>
<p>Our school’s <strong>motto, “Frugality and Honesty,”</strong> reflects our
humble beginnings. With limited resources, the founders emphasised frugality
and gratefulness, guided by the Chinese saying <strong>“饮水思源”</strong>—<em>“remember the source of water.”</em> This
saying, inscribed on the wall at the front of the school building, continues
to remind us of our purpose and the enduring legacy of our founding fathers.</p>
<p>Learning at Fuhua extends beyond the classroom. Students engage meaningfully
with the community—whether through sustainability initiatives with seniors,
community gardening, or neighbourhood programmes in partnership with the
Yuhua CCC. These experiences cultivate empathy, responsibility, and active
citizenship.</p>
<p>Our signature programme, <strong>GEM+</strong>, brings these values to
life. Students apply their learning from the Applied Learning Programme
(ALP) and Learning for Life Programme (LLP) to serve the school and community
through Values-in-Action (VIA) initiatives, strengthening their skills
while making a positive impact.</p>
<p>As we celebrate <strong>85 years of excellence and meaningful impact</strong>,
I invite all students to embrace the learning opportunities ahead. To our
parents, I warmly welcome your continued partnership as we nurture, inspire,
and empower every child to achieve their fullest potential.</p>
<p>Thank you for choosing Fuhua Primary School. Let us honour our proud heritage
and build an even brighter future together in 2026.</p>
<p>Mr Ganesan Raman&nbsp;</p>
<p>Principal</p>
