<p>Welcome and warm greetings to all!</p>
<p>As the Principal, I am honoured to lead a community of dedicated educators,
talented students, and supportive parents towards a shared vision of excellence.
At Fuhua Primary School, our mission is to foster an environment that nurtures
not only academic excellence but also the holistic development of our students.
We are committed to shaping young minds into lifelong learners, citizen
leaders, and tech-savvy innovators who are well-equipped to thrive in the
dynamic challenges of the 21st century.</p>
<p>Our curriculum is designed to be robust, aiming not only to impart knowledge
but also to hone the essential 21st-century skills and competencies that
are crucial for success in today's rapidly evolving world. We strive to
prepare our students to be adaptable, critical thinkers, effective communicators,
and collaborative problem-solvers.</p>
<p>At Fuhua, we believe that education extends beyond the classroom. Therefore,
we provide a myriad of opportunities for our students to contribute meaningfully
to the school, the community, and beyond. These opportunities include engaging
elderly residents in the neighbourhood on areas of sustainability and food
security, partnering with seniors in community gardening within the school
premises, and working alongside the Yuhua CCC to partake in community events.
These meaningful experiences allow our students to become active and contributing
citizens.</p>
<p>Our signature programme, GEM+, exemplifies this belief. Through GEM+,
students leverage the knowledge and skills gained from the learning experiences
in our Applied Learning Programme (ALP) and Learning for Life Programme
(LLP) to serve the school and community through Values-in-Action (VIA)
initiatives. This provides students with authentic learning experiences
that hone their 21st-century skills while empowering them to be active
and compassionate contributors to society.</p>
<p>I invite all our students to actively engage in the plethora of activities
organised by the school. Your involvement will not only enrich your own
learning experience but also contribute to the vibrant tapestry of our
school community. To our parents, I warmly invite you to partner us in
realising the full potential of our students. Your support and collaboration
are invaluable as we work together to nurture and inspire every child to
achieve his/her best.</p>
<p>Together, we can create a nurturing and inspiring environment where every
student can flourish and reach his or her full potential.</p>
<p>Thank you for making Fuhua Primary your school of choice. Let us embark
on this academic journey hand in hand, working together to ensure a successful
and fulfilling year ahead.</p>
