On behalf of all staff and students of Fuhua Primary School, I would like to wish one and all a Happy New Year!

  

It is also with great pleasure I welcome the new addition to our Fuhua family, our 2022 P1 cohort of students and their parents.

  

2021 was a special year for Fuhua family as we turned 80. To celebrate the 8 decades of our contributions in developing generations of students and serving the community, we held our e-celebrations on Fri 19 November. During our e-celebrations, we launched our e-Heritage production and a Heritage corridor depicting the progress of our school and contributions of our stakeholders without whom the school would not have achieved its many accolades. May I invite you to view our e-celebrations at [Fuhua Primary School's 80th Anniversary Celebrations](https://go.gov.sg/fhps80thanniversarycelebrations).

  

At Fuhua, we believe that every student has an innate ability to learn and flourish. We envisage our students to be **Lifelong learners** who take ownership of their own learning. As such, we focus on strengthening fundamentals and creating opportunities for our students to hone their 4 Cs namely Creativity, Communication, Collaboration and Critical Thought through a robust curriculum. 

  

Our Applied Learning Programme – Students as Designers for the 21st century and Learning for Life Programme- Environmental Champions, serve as rich learning platforms for students to apply their learning and contribute to the community. As the Zonal Centre of Excellence for ICT, we aim to be the trailblazer in experimenting with new technologies to enhance our students’ learning experiences. Our students are indeed versatile in using technological tools in co-constructing new knowledge with fellow peers. 

  

The world is evolving fast, and students must be equipped with the necessary knowledge and skills to face the challenges of the future. A primary school education anchored in strong fundamentals and values is necessary for our students to thrive in the VUCA world. We will strive to design positive school experiences that will bring about deeper learning to realise our student outcomes of **Lifelong Learner, Citizen Leader and Tech-Savvy Innovator**.

  

My best wishes to all staff, students and partners of Fuhua. May we stand united and scale greater heights in our endeavours!

  

Mr Ganesan Raman
