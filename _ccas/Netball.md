<p><strong><u>Nurturing Values Through Netball</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Netball is a dynamic CCA that nurtures essential life values such as resilience,
teamwork, and a growth mindset. Through regular training sessions and skill-building
exercises, students not only develop their proficiency in the sport but
also strengthen personal attributes that benefit them beyond the court.
The supportive and encouraging environment empowers students to push past
challenges and grow both as athletes and individuals.</p>

<p><strong><u>Leadership and teamwork</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The Netball CCA provides a strong platform for peer bonding and leadership
development. Students form close-knit teams as they train and grow together.
Seniors are given opportunities to guide and mentor their juniors, sharing
strategies and techniques while reinforcing their own skills. This collaborative
setting fosters mutual respect and helps build a culture of support and
continuous improvement within the team.</p>

<p><strong><u>Opportunities to represent the school</u></strong>
</p>
<p>From Primary 4 onwards, students in the Netball CCA have the exciting
opportunity to represent Fuhua Primary School in the National School Games
(NSG). This invaluable experience allows them to showcase their talent,
apply their training in competitive settings, and develop sportsmanship
and school pride while competing with schools across the nation.</p>
