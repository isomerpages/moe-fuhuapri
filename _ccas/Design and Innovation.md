<p><strong>Design &amp; Innovation Club: Where Ideas Take Shape</strong>
</p>
<p>The Design &amp; Innovation Club is a dynamic co-curricular activity that
inspires students to explore, create, and innovate. Through hands-on projects
that blend creativity with basic mechanical and electrical technologies,
students are encouraged to transform their ideas into functional models
and working prototypes.</p>
<p>In the Design &amp; Innovation Club, failure is not the end—it’s a vital
part of the learning process. Students are taught to view setbacks as opportunities
for growth. They learn to persevere through challenges, revise their designs,
and keep experimenting until they succeed. This builds resilience and fosters
a mindset of continuous improvement.</p>
<p>From constructing simple machines to building circuits and basic electronic
devices, members develop practical skills while applying scientific and
engineering principles in fun and engaging ways. Every project fuels imagination
and develops critical thinking, problem-solving, and collaboration.</p>
<p>Above all, the Design &amp; Innovation Club nurtures a spirit of innovation
and self-expression. It is a space where creativity thrives, mistakes are
embraced, and students learn that with persistence and passion, anything
is possible.</p>
