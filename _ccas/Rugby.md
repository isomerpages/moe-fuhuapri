<p><strong><u>Rugby is more than a game — it’s a test of strength, spirit, and character.</u></strong>
</p>
<p>At Fuhua Primary, our Rugby CCA challenges students to grow tougher, think
smarter, and stand stronger — both on and off the field. Every training
session is a step toward mastering the sport, but more importantly, a step
toward building resilience, grit, teamwork, and a fearless mindset. In
an environment driven by encouragement and perseverance, students learn
to rise after every fall and push beyond their limits.</p>

<p><strong><u>Forging Leaders. Building Teams.</u></strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Rugby is a team sport like no other — it demands trust, loyalty, and leadership.</p>
<p>At Fuhua, students train as one unit, forging strong bonds and learning
the true meaning of teamwork. Seniors take the lead, guiding juniors through
drills, strategies, and game-play with confidence and care. These moments
of mentorship shape not just better players, but leaders who uplift others.
Together, they build a team culture rooted in respect, discipline, and
shared victory.</p>

<p><strong><u>Proudly Wearing Our Colours</u></strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>From Primary 4 onwards, our players have the thrilling opportunity to
represent Fuhua Primary School at the National School Games (NSG). Competing
on the national stage fuels their passion and pride — as they battle shoulder
to shoulder, students experience the thrill of competition, the meaning
of sportsmanship, and the honour of carrying their school’s name with courage.</p>
