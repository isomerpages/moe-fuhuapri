<p>Students benefit from being in a choir in many meaningful ways. Musical
benefits would be vocal development, musical literacy and listening skills.
Social and emotional benefits would be teamwork, confidence and emotional
expression. They also get to improve their memory and focus, language skills
and discipline.</p>
<p>Our school choir has been participating in Singapore Youth Festival Arts
Presentation (SYF AP). In 2024, under the tutelage of Mr Phua Ee Kia, the
Choir CCA has received a Certificate of Distinction. It has also been actively
contributing to the musical culture in school, as well as proudly participating
in public performances. The choir has trainings every Tuesday morning and
Thursday afternoon.</p>
