#### **CCA Percussion Ensemble**


Members: Boys & Girls  

In a typical music arrangement, drums merely play a supporting role to the main melody. These roles become reversed in Percussion Ensemble. We develop the rhythmic abilities in each student. Expect a challenging yet rewarding experience â€“ one that features stick work training, body percussion, multi-instrument arrangements, and perhaps even a live performance!
