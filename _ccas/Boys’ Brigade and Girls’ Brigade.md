Members: Boys

At Boys' Brigade 24J Company, we seek to nurture the community spiritedness in the Boys’ through community service projects. They develop empathy while caring for the community around them. We also seek to strengthen the boys’ physical fitness and develop their personal mastery and leadership potential through meaningful and purposeful activities such as team building, squad drills, parades and life skills activities.
