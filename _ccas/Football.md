<p><strong>Nurturing Values through Football</strong>
</p>
<p>Football is an exciting CCA that instils important life values such as
teamwork, resilience, and a never-give-up attitude. The boys undergo regular
training sessions and skill-building exercises that benefit them not only
on the field but also in everyday life. At Fuhua, football boys grow stronger
with each step, ready to take on any challenge that comes their way. The
values nurtured through football—such as discipline, respect, and perseverance—are
expected to shine not just on the field, but also in the classroom and
in each boy’s daily conduct. These values help shape them into responsible
and well-rounded individuals.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Leadership/Teamwork</strong>
<br>The Football CCA provides a strong platform for peer bonding and leadership
development. The CCA consists of two groups—the Fireflies (School Team)
and Glowworms (Training Team)—who form close-knit communities as they train
and improve together. Seniors are given opportunities to mentor their juniors
by initiating warm-ups, teaching football skills, and sharing strategies.
This mentorship fosters mutual respect and drives the boys to progress
together as a united team. Teamwork is at the heart of the Football CCA.
We do not believe in star players, but in every individual playing an important
role and working together toward a common goal. Success is achieved not
through individual glory, but through unity, trust, and collective effort.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Opportunities to represent the School</strong>
</p>
<p>From Primary 4 onwards, students in the Football CCA have the exciting
opportunity to represent Fuhua Primary School in the National School Games
(NSG). The team also plays regular friendly matches with schools such as
Westwood Primary School, Henry Park Primary School, and Xingnan Primary
School. These valuable experiences allow players to showcase their talent,
apply their training in real game settings, and develop sportsmanship and
school pride.</p>

<p><em>"May the fireflies follow you where the butterflies won't." - </em>Mr.
Hairi
<br>This powerful quote reminds us that fireflies shine even in the darkest
times—offering hope, resilience, and guidance when the path gets tough.
Our boys carry that same spark as they grow through football.</p>
