<p>The Speech and Drama Club provides students with a dynamic platform to
foster creativity, teamwork, and confidence. Our young actors receive training
in essential drama techniques, including voice projection, improvisation,
and scriptwriting. They collaborate to create engaging tableaux and short
skits. Annually, students participate in the <em>SYF The Young Playwright Presents</em>,
where they write scripts and perform in group-acted, recorded submissions.
A yearly highlight is performing for the entire school during special celebrations
like National Day. To deepen their appreciation of theatre, students also
embark on a learning journey to a local acting company and attend a drama
workshop. If you love being in the spotlight, this is the CCA for you!</p>
