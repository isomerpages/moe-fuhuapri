Students will learn how to contribute to the education of young people, through a value system based on the Scout Promise and Law, to help build a better world where people are self-fulfilled as individuals and play a constructive role in society. They will aim to earn a series of Badges, which give them a knowledge of basic Scouting skills and mark achievements in areas such as camp craft.
