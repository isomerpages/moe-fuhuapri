<p><strong>Welcome to Scouts (Cub Scouts Section)</strong>
</p>
<p>At Fuhua Primary School, our Scouts CCA serves students aged 7 to 12 and
is part of the Cub Scouts programme—designed specially for primary school
boys and girls. While the CCA is named 'Scouts,' our members at this age
are part of the Cub Scouts section, where they engage in age-appropriate
activities that build leadership, resilience, and a strong sense of community—laying
the foundation for their continued journey in the Scouting movement.</p>
<p><strong>Learning Through Adventure</strong>
</p>
<p>In Cub Scouts, we believe in learning by doing. Our activities are both
intellectually stimulating and physically engaging, helping children build
resilience, teamwork, and independence. From life skills and outdoor adventures
to creativity and problem-solving, Cubs gain real-world experience that
stays with them for life.</p>
<p><strong>Our Structure</strong>
</p>
<p>Cubs meet weekly and are grouped into small teams called <em>Sixes</em>.
Each Six is led by a <em>Sixer</em>—a Cub selected for their leadership
qualities and guided by the Cub Scout Leader. This structure encourages
peer support and hands-on leadership, empowering Cubs to take responsibility
and care for one another.</p>
<p><strong>What We Do</strong>
</p>
<p>Every meeting is an opportunity for growth, exploration, and fun. Cubs
take part in:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Team-based games and challenges</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Outdoor activities like hiking, camping, and shelter-building</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Life skills such as cooking and first aid</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Craftwork, knotting, and classic Scouting skills</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Making new friends and building lasting memories</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>At Cub Scouts, every child has the chance to lead, learn, and discover
their potential—all while having a great time.</p>
