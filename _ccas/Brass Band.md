<p>Fuhua Primary School Brass Band is a vibrant co-curricular activity (CCA)
that nurtures young musicians through the art of brass and percussion music.
Open to students with a passion for music, the band provides opportunities
to develop instrumental skills, teamwork, and discipline in a fun and engaging
environment.</p>
<p>Under the guidance of experienced band instructors, members learn to play
various brass instruments such as the cornet, trombone, and euphonium,
as well as percussion. They also gain valuable ensemble experience through
rehearsals and performances at school events, national competitions, and
community outreach programs.</p>
<p>Beyond musical growth, the Brass Band fosters confidence, resilience,
and a sense of camaraderie among students. Whether performing an uplifting
march or a soulful melody, our young musicians take pride in sharing their
music with the school and the wider community.</p>
<p>Join the Primary School Brass Band and embark on a musical journey filled
with learning, friendship, and unforgettable experiences!</p>
