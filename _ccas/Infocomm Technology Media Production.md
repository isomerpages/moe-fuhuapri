<p>In the Media Production CCA, students explore diverse forms of media and
develop into tech-savvy innovators equipped with 21st-century skills. The
CCA is structured around four core modules: Cyber Wellness, Photography,
Videography, and Studio Production. Through these modules, members gain
foundational knowledge and hands-on experience, enabling them to communicate
impactful messages using creative digital tools.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Cyber Wellness</strong>
</p>
<p>In today’s digital age, cyber wellness is more crucial than ever. Members
learn about key aspects such as screen time management, responsible cyber
identity, and safe online practices. They also contribute meaningfully
to the school community by designing posters and delivering engaging assembly
presentations that promote positive digital habits.</p>
<p><strong>Photography</strong>
</p>
<p>Using DSLR and mirrorless cameras, students are introduced to the basics
of photography. They explore composition, lighting, and storytelling through
the lens. Their photographs are further enhanced with photo-editing techniques,
allowing them to present compelling visual narratives.</p>
<p><strong>Videography</strong>
</p>
<p>Members apply fundamental videography skills to create videos that convey
purposeful messages. This year, they ventured into Stop Motion Animation,
embedding themes of cyber wellness into their creative projects. Through
scripting, filming, and editing, students learn how to bring stories to
life through video.</p>
<p><strong>Studio Production</strong>
</p>
<p>With access to an in-house green screen, members work collaboratively
to simulate real studio production environments. They take on various roles
such as cameraman, director, and editor while producing themed video content.
These experiences build confidence, teamwork, and technical expertise.</p>
<p>Beyond regular sessions, members are encouraged to challenge themselves
by participating in national competitions such as MOE’s "Our Schools, Our
Stories" and the Singapore Infocomm Challenge, which provide valuable opportunities
to showcase their talents and creativity.</p>
