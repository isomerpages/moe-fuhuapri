<p>Fuhua &nbsp;Basketball CCA is a dynamic program that cultivates young
athletes through the exciting sport of basketball. Open to students with
enthusiasm for team sports, the CCA provides a comprehensive platform for
developing essential basketball skills, physical fitness and character
development.</p>
<p>Under the guidance of experienced coaches, members develop fundamental
basketball techniques including dribbling, shooting, passing, and defensive
skills. The program emphasizes both individual growth and team dynamics,
fostering important values such as resilience, discipline, sportsmanship,
and leadership through regular training sessions.</p>
<p>Our basketball CCA features several signature initiatives that enhance
students' learning experience.For example,, we work with ActiveSg to allow
our Primary 3 students experience interesting basketball activities in
Semester 1. These &nbsp;&nbsp;experiences allows them to make informed
decisions during P3 CCA registration exercise.. Our CCA also organises
friendly matches with local and international schools, providing valuable
exposure and competition experience for our players prior to National School
Games.</p>
<p>The CCA achieved a significant milestone in 2024 with its participation
in the National School Games (NSG), where our students demonstrated exceptional
determination and team spirit. International exchanges, such as the friendly
matches with the Basketball Youth Association Shenzhen, China in 2024 and
2025 offer our students unique opportunities to compete against and learn
from overseas peers passionate about basketball.</p>
