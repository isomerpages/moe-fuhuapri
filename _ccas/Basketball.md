Fuhua  Basketball CCA is a dynamic program that cultivates young athletes through the exciting sport of basketball. Open to students with enthusiasm for team sports, the CCA provides a comprehensive platform for developing essential basketball skills, physical fitness and character development.

Under the guidance of experienced coaches, members develop fundamental basketball techniques including dribbling, shooting, passing, and defensive skills. The program emphasizes both individual growth and team dynamics, fostering important values such as resilience, discipline, sportsmanship, and leadership through regular training sessions.

Our basketball CCA features several signature initiatives that enhance students' learning experience.For example,, we work with ActiveSg to allow our Primary 3 students experience interesting basketball activities in Semester 1. These   experiences allows them to make informed decisions during P3 CCA registration exercise.. Our CCA also organises friendly matches with local and international schools, providing valuable exposure and competition experience for our players prior to National School Games.

The CCA achieved a significant milestone in 2024 with its participation in the National School Games (NSG), where our students demonstrated exceptional determination and team spirit. International exchanges, such as the friendly matches with the Basketball Youth Association Shenzhen, China in 2024 and 2025 offer our students unique opportunities to compete against and learn from overseas peers passionate about basketball.

Join the Fuhua Primary School Basketball CCA and embark on an exciting journey of athletic development, friendship, and memorable experiences!
