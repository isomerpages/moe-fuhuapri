<p>The Environmental Science Club's activities aim to cultivate socially
responsible and environmentally conscious individuals. Members take an
active role in promoting sustainability by leading assembly talks on topics
such as reducing food waste, recycling, and protecting coral reefs. They
also conduct hands-on workshops, including vermicomposting and upcycling
sessions where students create paper baskets from used paper, pouches from
food wrappers, and tote bags from old T-shirts.</p>
<p>Gardening plays a key role in the clubâ€™s efforts, with members engaged
in both traditional soil-based gardening and soilless hydroponic systems.
The vegetables grown are harvested and distributed, reinforcing values
of self-sufficiency and community care. The club also organizes birdwatching
outings and dengue prevention campaigns to raise awareness about biodiversity
and public health.</p>
<p>Through these enriching experiences, members deepen their commitment to
environmental conservation and make meaningful contributions to the well-being
of our community. Join us and be part of the change toward a greener, healthier
future!</p>
