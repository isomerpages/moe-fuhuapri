<p><strong><u>Modern Dance Club</u></strong>
</p>
<p>At Fuhua’s Modern Dance CCA, we empower students to discover their unique
voice through movement while developing character, resilience, and teamwork.
Through purposeful choreography and energetic sessions, students grow in
confidence, creativity, and physical wellness — key pillars of holistic
development.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Led by an experienced instructor, our dancers explore a wide range of
styles and techniques, engaging both the body and mind. The programme nurtures
a love for the arts while cultivating values, social-emotional skills,
and a strong sense of identity.</p>
<p><strong>Key Learning Outcomes:</strong>
</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Creative Expression &amp; Innovation</strong>
<br>Students explore ways to convey emotions and narratives through dance
— sparking imagination and cultivating a spirit of creativity.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Skill Mastery &amp; Discipline</strong>
<br>From coordination and posture to flexibility and rhythm, students gain
mastery of movement while building perseverance and self-discipline.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Collaboration &amp; Respect</strong>
<br>In group choreography and performances, students learn to listen, lead,
and support one another, fostering empathy and teamwork.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Confidence &amp; Communication</strong>
<br>Through rehearsals and performances, students build stage presence and
express themselves confidently — both verbal and non-verbal communication
are enhanced.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Community Engagement &amp; National Identity</strong>
<br>Our dancers proudly represent the school in events such as Chingay, the
Singapore Youth Festival, and community showcases at Yuhua CC — developing
pride in contributing to school and society.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Healthy Living &amp; Well-being</strong>
<br>Regular practice promotes active living and mental well-being, helping
students stay fit while managing stress through a joyful and expressive
outlet.</p>
<p>Modern Dance CCA is more than just movement but also a platform for personal
growth, meaningful friendships, and discovering the joy of performing together.
Let’s move, express, and grow — as one vibrant dance family!</p>
