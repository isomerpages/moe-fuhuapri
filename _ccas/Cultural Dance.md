The Cultural Dance CCA aims to nurture passionate and confident dancers with a strong appreciation for various cultural dances. Our experienced and professional instructor coaches our students on the fundamental skills of different cultural dances to develop their grace, flexibility, balance and co-ordination. High discipline is also incorporated into the rigorous training sessions to develop resilience and teaches our dancers to set high standards for themselves.

The CCA provides many opportunities for our cultural dancers to showcase their talents by performing in school events (for example, Chinese New Year celebrations), community events (Yuhua CC performances) and also at the Singapore Youth Festival. These experiences help to build our dancers’ stage experience and confidence level.

Join us on a journey of rhythm, expression, and creativity! Our Cultural Dance CCA provides an inspiring platform for young dancers to develop lifelong skills, forge lasting friendships and discover the magic of dance. Let's dance, learn, and grow together.
