<p>The Cultural Dance CCA nurtures passionate and confident dancers with
a deep appreciation for diverse cultural dance forms. Under the guidance
of our experienced instructor, students develop grace, flexibility, balance,
and coordination while mastering fundamental dance techniques. Our rigorous
trainings aim to instil among our students the values of discipline, resilience,
and a commitment to excellence.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To build their confidence and stage presence, our cultural dancers are
presented with numerous opportunities to showcase their talents at various
platforms. These performances include our school celebrations during Chinese
New Year, community events with Yuhua CC during National Day, and presenting
the school in the prestigious Singapore Youth Festival.</p>
<p>Join us on a journey of rhythm, expression, and creativity! Through Cultural
Dance CCA, students not only hone their skills but also forge lasting friendships
and embrace the joy of dance. Let’s dance, learn, and grow together!</p>
