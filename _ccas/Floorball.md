<p>FHPS Floorball CCA is a co-ed sport open to both boys and girls. The CCA
consists of two teams – the Engagement Team and the Excellence Team. Besides
the regular Tuesday CCA sessions, students who are eager to further develop
their skills are welcome to join additional practice sessions on Monday
afternoons.</p>
<p>Under the dedicated guidance of our Floorball coaches, our floorball players
continuously refine their passing and shooting techniques, while sharpening
their speed, strategy, and intensity in preparation for the upcoming National
School Games (NSG). In 2024, the School Team played in their inaugural
NSG and secured first place in Tier 3 (Junior Boys Division). The boys
certainly made the school proud with their teamwork, coordination, and
sportsmanship.</p>
<p>Want to try Floorball CCA? It is a high energy sport that is easy to pick
up. Whether you are looking to take up the sport just to have some fun
or train up for National School Games, floorball is worth a shot.</p>
