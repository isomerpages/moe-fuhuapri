strategy and intensity to achieve their best results in the upcoming National
School Games (NSG). In 2024, the School Team played in their inaugural
NSG and secured first place in Tier 3 (Junior Boys Division). The boys
certainly made the school proud with their teamwork, coordination, and
sportsmanship.</p>
