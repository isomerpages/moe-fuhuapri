<p>At Fuhua’s Infocomm Technology Club (Computing) aka Coding Club, we empower
students to express their creativity using coding to solve a variety of
problems encountered in their projects by actively learning from and sharing
with peers.</p>
<p>Through our comprehensive Coding programs, students are empowered to make
exciting, personal ideas come to life through coding by creating meaningful
software applications through learning, practicing and refining of the
coding design process.</p>
<p>Students also get to learn and demonstrate Core Values (respect, care,
integrity, perseverance and excellence), teamwork, Social and Emotional
Competencies and 21CC through playing Coding.</p>
<p><strong>Key Learning Outcomes:</strong>
</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Innovative Coding &amp; Creative Expression</strong>
<br>Students explore different ways to code a program. This helps to spark
their imagination and cultivating a spirit of creativity.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Skill Mastery in Different Coding Domains</strong>
<br>Students gain mastery of Scratch programming, Drones application, Manoeuvering
Mbots using MakeBlock software, operating Temi robots &amp; Games development.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Collaboration &amp; Respect</strong>
<br>In group projects, students learn to listen, lead, and support one another,
fostering empathy and teamwork.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Confidence &amp; Signature Identity</strong>
<br>Through national competitions, students build confidence. Our students
have participated in national competitions like Singapore RoboCup Open,
Drone Odyssey Challenge &amp; MakeX and have garnered top positions for
many years. This creates a unique identity and legacy for Fuhua Coding
Club. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Coding Club CCA allows students to prepare for future career opportunities.
In today's technology-driven society, coding and programming skills are
becoming increasingly important in a wide range of industries. By joining
our Fuhua Coding Club, students can build a strong foundation in programming
that can be applied in fields such as finance, healthcare, and media in
future while having great fun at the same time.</p>
