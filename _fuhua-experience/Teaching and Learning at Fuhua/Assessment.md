<h3><strong>2026 Assessment Matters&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p>We are committed to nurturing our Fuhua Gems to be lifelong learners who
take ownership of their learning and derive joy from the learning process.
In line with this commitment, we have moved away from an over-emphasis
on academic results and would like to share our school-based assessment
practices with you. These practices aim to provide more opportunities for
student-centred teaching and learning approaches that support students'
holistic development, self-discovery and engaged learning.</p>
<h4><strong>Guiding Principles</strong></h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Assessment forms an integral part of teaching and learning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assessment information is used to provide feedback to students, enhance
teaching and learning practices, and make informed school-based decisions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assessment is designed in alignment to the intended learning outcomes
and content stated in the subject syllabuses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assessment load and demand are manageable and support sustainable learning.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong>School Policy on Absence From Assessment</strong></h4>
<p>For students who are absent from any school-based assessment, a valid
Medical Certificate <strong>(MC)</strong> is required to cover their absence.
The school will consider other valid reasons for absence on a case-by-case
basis. Upon the student’s return to school, he/she will attempt the assessment
as a form of practice.</p>
<p>If a student is absent without a MC or a valid reason, he/she will be
awarded a score of zero for the missed paper/component.</p>
<h4><strong>School Attendance</strong></h4>
<p>On this related note, we would like to reiterate the importance of regular
school attendance and its impact on student achievement. A missed school
day is a lost opportunity for students to learn. When students miss school
without valid reasons, not only do they miss out on the educational content
and learning opportunities in a social context, but upon their return,
they spend most of their time and energy re-adjusting to the classroom
routines and expectations.</p>
<p>When learning is uninterrupted and consistently follows from one learning
concept to another, students are better supported in their learning and
thus make significant progress. At Fuhua Primary School, we want to emphasise
the importance of consistency in efforts to yield the best learning outcomes
for themselves.</p>
