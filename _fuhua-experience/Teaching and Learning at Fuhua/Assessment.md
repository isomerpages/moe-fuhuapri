<h3><strong>2024 SCHOOL-BASED ASSESSMENT</strong></h3><p>We are committed to nurture our Fuhua Gems to be lifelong learners who take ownership of their own learning and derive joy in their learning process. In line with this, we are moving away from an over-emphasis on academic results and have made changes to our school-based assessment. Time and space have been freed up to provide more opportunities for student-centred teaching and learning approaches that will allow for students' holistic development, self-discovery and engaged learning.</p><h4><strong>Guiding Principles</strong></h4><p>i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Assessment forms an integral part of teaching and learning.</p><p>ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Assessment information is used to provide feedback to students, enhance teaching and learning practices, and make informed school-based decisions.</p><p>iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Assessment is designed in alignment to the intended learning outcomes and content stated in the subject syllabuses.</p><p>iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Assessment load and demand are manageable and supports sustainable learning.</p><p></p><h4><strong>Overview of P1 - P6 Assessment Weightings</strong></h4><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Fuhua Experience/Teaching and Learning @ Fuhua/Assessment/assessement_weightings.jpg"></div><h4><strong>P1- P6 Assessments Plan</strong></h4><p>Click <a href="https://fuhuapri.moe.edu.sg/assessment/Primary-3/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a> for Primary 3 Assessment</p><p>Click <a href="https://fuhuapri.moe.edu.sg/assessment/primary-4/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a> for Primary 4 Assessment</p><p>Click <a href="https://fuhuapri.moe.edu.sg/assessment/primary-5/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a> for Primary 5 Assessment</p><p>Click <a href="https://fuhuapri.moe.edu.sg/assessment/primary-6/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a> for Primary 6 Assessment</p><h4><strong>School Policy on Absence From Assessment</strong></h4><p>For students who are absent from any school-based assessment, a valid Medical Certificate <strong>(MC) </strong>is required to cover their absence. The school will consider other valid reasons for absence on a case-by-case basis. Upon the student's return to school, he/she will attempt the assessment as a form of practice.</p><p>If a student is absent without a MC or a valid reason, he/she will be awarded a score of zero for the missed paper/component.</p><p></p>
