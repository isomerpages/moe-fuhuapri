##### **2023 SCHOOL-BASED ASSESSMENT**

In line with the Ministry of Educationâ€™s directive to place greater emphasis on joy of learning and reducing the focus on assessment grades and perceived examination stakes, we have made changes to our school-based assessments. School-based assessment, unlike national examination (i.e. the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE), is generally not high-stake. With the reduction in the number of school-based assessments, more time and space has been freed to provide more opportunities for student-centred teaching and learning approaches to strengthen holistic development, self-discovery and engaged learning towards nurturing life-long learning attitudes and skills.
