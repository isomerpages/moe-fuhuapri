<h3><u>Background</u></h3>
<p>The world we are living in is changing and education must evolve to respond
to the changes. If we live in an interconnected and interdependent world,
it only makes sense that knowledge is presented as interconnected and interdependent
(Drake, 1998). At Fuhua, we endeavour for our students to acquire deeper
learning through an engaging curriculum. Deeper learning is acquired by
learners when they see patterns, make connections and apply learning in
real life contexts. The framework guides the school in planning learning
experiences in support of developing student outcomes.</p>
<h4><u>Lesson Design</u></h4>
<p>The school leverages Understand by Design (UbD) curriculum framework in
our lesson design. Lesson units are designed anchored on Big Ideas with
accompanying Enduring Understandings (EU) and Essential Questions (EQ)
to facilitate learning. Success Criteria are articulated in the unit plans
to evaluate the impact of teaching strategies on student learning.</p>
<h4><u>Tenets in the T&amp;L framework</u></h4>
<h4>(A)&nbsp;&nbsp; Transdisciplinary and Interdisciplinary Integration</h4>
<p>For students to make connections between different subject disciplines,
interdisciplinary learning opportunities are planned where possible. Interdisciplinary
learning is intentionally designed for students to acquire deeper learning.
For instance, the EL curriculum design in the Lower Primary allows students
to make connections with the natural environment around them. As part of
understanding their Stellar Texts on animals, students embark on a learning
journey to the zoo to experience real-life application of learning. Similarly,
Math concepts are applied in Science experiments where students organize
and present data to draw conclusions.</p>
<p>Students experience Transdisciplinary learning through project-based learning.
One such project-based learning is GEM+ where students apply their key
learnings from ALP and LLP to solve real-life problems. The school has
identiﬁed IC<sup>3</sup> namely Inventing &amp; Critical Thinking, Communication
and Collaboration to be honed through project-based learning. In the design
of the learning experiences for GEM+, programme owners incorporate activities
that will help students to hone the IC<sup>3</sup>.</p>
<p>In designing the learning experiences for students both in and out of
the classroom, careful consideration is given to integrate the learning
outcomes, IC<sup>3</sup>, subject-speciﬁc competencies and learning dispositions.</p>
<h4>(B)&nbsp;&nbsp; Tech-enabled pedagogies</h4>
<p>The school leverages tech-enabled pedagogies to foster collaboration,
inventive and critical thinking. Tech-enabled lesson designs are anchored
on Key Applications of Technology (KAT) to ensure integration of technology
is meaningful for the students. Key considerations of Tech tools for T&amp;L
include opportunities for students to hone IC<sup>3</sup> and age appropriateness.</p>
<h4>(C)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Learner-Centered and Balanced Assessment</h4>
<p>Assessment is integral part of learning, and the school aims for students
to take ownership of their own learning through the design of leaner-centered
and balanced assessment. Learner-centered assessment takes into consideration
student readiness and is aimed at providing feedback. A variety of modes
of assessment which include self and peer assessment, goal setting, reﬂection
and monitoring of their own learning progress are considered to assess
student’s learning. A balanced assessment includes a good balance of formative
and summative assessment practices to ensure that our students are developed
and assessed holistically (i.e. in all academic and non- academic areas
and dispositions, values and 21CC)</p>
