<p><strong><u>Background</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The world we are living in is changing and education must evolve to respond
to the changes. If we live in an interconnected and interdependent world,
it only makes sense that knowledge is presented as interconnected and interdependent
(Drake, 1998). At Fuhua, we endeavour for our students to acquire deeper
learning through an engaging curriculum. Deeper learning is acquired by
learners when they see patterns, make connections and apply learning in
real life contexts. The framework guides the school in planning learning
experiences in support of developing student outcomes.</p>
<p><strong><u>Lesson Design</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The school leverages Understand by Design (UbD) curriculum framework in
guiding our lesson design. Lesson units are designed anchored on Big Ideas
with accompanying Enduring Understanding (EU) and Essential Questions (EQ)
to facilitate learning. Success Criteria are articulated in the unit plans
to evaluate the impact of teaching strategies on student learning.</p>
<p><strong><u>Tenets in the T&amp;L framework</u></strong>
</p>
<p><strong>(A) Transdisciplinary and Interdisciplinary Integration</strong>
</p>
<p>For students to make connections between different subject disciplines,
interdisciplinary learning opportunities are planned where possible. Interdisciplinary
learning is intentionally designed for students to acquire deeper learning.
For instance, the EL curriculum design in the Lower Primary allows students
to make connections with the natural environment around them. As part of
understanding their Stellar Texts on animals, students embark on a learning
journey to the zoo to experience real-life application of learning. Similarly,
Math concepts are applied in Science experiments where students organize
and present data to draw conclusions.</p>
<p>Students experience Transdisciplinary learning through project-based learning.
One such project-based learning is GEM+ where students apply their key
learnings from ALP and LLP to solve real-life problems. The school has
identified 4Cs namely communication, collaboration, creativity and critical
thinking to be honed through project-based learning.</p>
<p>In the design of the learning experiences for GEM+, programme owners incorporate
activities that will help students to hone the 4Cs. In designing the learning
experiences for students both in and out of the classroom, careful consideration
is given to integrate the learning outcomes, 4Cs, subject-specific competencies
and learning dispositions.</p>
<p><strong>(B) Tech-enabled pedagogies </strong>
</p>
<p>The school leverages tech-enabled pedagogies to foster collaboration and
creative production. Tech-enabled lesson designs are anchored on Key Applications
of Technology (KAT) to ensure integration of technology is meaningful for
the students. Key considerations of Tech tools for T&amp;L include opportunities
for students to hone 4Cs and age appropriateness.</p>
<p><strong>(C) Learner-Centered and Balanced Assessment</strong>
</p>
<p>Assessment is integral part of learning, and the school aims for student
to take ownership of their own learning through the design of leaner-centerd
and balanced assessment. Learner-centered assessment takes into consideration
student readiness and is aimed at providing feedback. A variety of modes
of assessment which include self and peer assessment, setting of goals,
reflection and monitoring of their own learning progress are considered
to assess studentâ€™s learning. A Balanced assessment includes a good balance
of formative and summative assessment practices to ensure that our students
are developed and assessed holistically (i.e. in all academic and nonacademic
areas and dispositions, values and 21CC</p>
