<p>Student development focuses on fostering a culture of care, school ethos,
well-being for our Fuhua students by creating a positive learning environment
for them. Together they create opportunities for students to excel by embracing
diversity in school, and to learn by leading through collaboration. In
doing so, Fuhua students also build a community of citizen leaders who
receive and, with a grateful heart exemplify the school values of Respect,
Care, Integrity, Perseverance and Excellence (ReCIPE).</p>
