#### **CCA @ FHPS**


Fuhua’s CCA Programme provides students with a wide range of programmes to discover their interests and talents. The programme prepare our students with a life-long pursuit of a balanced and healthy lifestyle in sports and the aesthetics. 

  

Our school actively engages strategic alliances to strengthen our CCA programme with external clubs and agencies such as ActiveSG.  Together we build communities and develop the bonds across social and cultural differences pursuing our healthy future together.  

  

Our CCA programme aims to fuel our students with a life-long love in an activity of their interest, such as a sport or a musical pursuit. This helps our students to lead a balanced life in adulthood. Students are able to develop their character and values through their experience in CCA. It will also prepare them to manage challenging environments through positive and active participation.

#### **EXPERIENCE | ENGAGEMENT | EXCELLENCE**


Our CCA programme seeks to provide the breadth and depth of experiences to students as they embark on a journey of exploration and discovery. These experiences are designed to deepen students’ development of knowledge and skills, and purposefully planned to support development of character, citizenship, and achievement of the 21st Century student  competencies.

  

We also recognise the different interests and learning needs of students. As such, our programme can be broadly classified into 3 tiers of participation.

Within this structure, our programmes and activities provide a healthy balance of collaboration and allow for participation at different levels to promote students’ overall enjoyment.

Students can choose from any of these 4 categories:  

  

• Physical sports

• Visual and performing arts

• Clubs and societies

• Uniformed groups

  

Each CCA has its specific objectives. For instance, Physical Sports (PS) develop robustness, fair play and team spirit in students. The Visual and Performing Arts (VPA) instill in students a sense of graciousness and an appreciation for the rich culture and heritage of a multi-racial society. Clubs and Societies (CS) allow students to explore and extend their interests in wide ranging and specialised areas which may be knowledge-based or skills-based. 

  

Students hone their information, communication, and technical skills as they strive to grow their mastery of the specialised areas. Uniformed Groups (UG) develop students with their strong character-building platform, as they help to instil commitment and loyalty to the nation, develop ruggedness of body and mind as well as cultivate leadership qualities and discipline in our students.
