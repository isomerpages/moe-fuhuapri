Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) has always been at the heart of Singapore’s education system. The global developments that impact our society, such as societal changes, globalisation and technological advancements are taken into consideration in the development of CCE at Fuhua. The design of the school’s CCE curriculum takes reference from MOE’s CCE 2021 Curriculum Framework as shown in Figure 1 and is anchored on the school’s vision, mission and values.

#### **CURRICULUM CONTENT**


The curriculum content of CCE is based on the three big ideas of Identity, Relationships and Choices, and centralise on the focus of developing a sense of purpose in our students. Fuhua Primary School believes in developing Citizen Leaders who are responsible to their family and community; and understand their roles in shaping the future of our nation. Thus, we aim to nurture Citizen Leaders who will be developed in the areas of Character and Leadership as well as Citizenry. More specifically, we enable each student to develop a sense of culture, history, passion, purpose, identity, belonging and personality that bring them their distinctive backbone and character. 

  

#### **ENACTMENT OF CCE**


There are several learning platforms where CCE is enacted with intentionality. These include CCE lessons during curriculum time, Key Student Development Experiences beyond the classroom, school-based initiatives and teachable moments during subject lessons and learning opportunities beyond Fuhua. 

  

**CCE Lessons**

These lessons provide the time for teachers to engage and build relationships with students through discussions and effective classroom strategies. Broadly, there are three ways CCE lesson time is used:

*   Explicit teaching of values and social and emotional skills to address holistic developmental needs of students. E.g. FTGP, CCE, SEd
*   Equip students with knowledge and skills to better understand real-world contexts. E.g. CW, NE
*   Discussion on contemporary issues to enable our students to grasp current realities in our national, regional and global contexts, reflect on their national identity, develop civic consciousness, and the will to make a difference in society, as well as learn social-emotional competencies and 21CC skills such as civic literacy, cross-cultural skills, and global awareness. E.g. NE, VIA

  

**CCE Experiences**

For CCE to be meaningful for our students, we provide them authentic learning opportunities within and beyond school for students to develop the habit of self-reflection and gratitude. CCE Experiences allow them to practise thinking back on positive and negative life experiences, they consider what can be learning from these experiences and commit to working towards better versions of themselves. CCE provides the knowledge and skills to help our students make sense of their life experiences and language to express their learning and development. At Fuhua, we provide students with such programmes:

*   Student Leadership Development (SLD) Programmes 
*   National Education (NE)
*   Trips to International Experiences (TIE) 
*   Values in Action (VIA)

#### **A CARING AND ENABLING SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT**


We take great pride in developing caring and responsible students with a pervasive growth mindset who are able to empathise with the people around them and be motivated to make a positive difference. We have intentionally created platforms to allow students to connect with others, feel emotionally and physically safe, have a sense of belonging, exercise autonomy, and experience competence. At Fuhua, our programmes are designed with these necessary features to meet our students’ needs:

*   Consistent and Coherent Messaging – E.g. Morning assembly with School Values application announcements 
*   Positive Teacher-Student Relationships – E.g. House System 
*   Peer Support and Relationships – E.g. SIXER and PAL
*   Student Voice and Ownership – E.g. CW
