Student development focuses on fostering a culture of care, school ethos, well-being for our Fuhua students by creating a positive learning environment for them. Together they create opportunities for students to excel by embracing diversity in school, and to learn by leading through collaboration. In doing so, Fuhua students also build a community of citizen leaders who receive and, with a grateful heart exemplify the school values of Respect, Care, Integrity, Perseverance and Excellence (ReCIPE).

#### **SIGNATURE PROGRAMMES**


1\. Transition Support  

  

One of the transition support programme - ‘Start-It-Right’- is an orientation programme that takes place in the 1st week of the school for all levels. This programme focuses on providing enriching learning opportunities for the students to ease well into the new academic year. Through this programme, teachers will guide students to relate well to others, navigate new social spaces and adapt themselves to the new social environment amidst new processes and structures.

  

At Fuhua, we believe that students learn best when they feel safe and confident. Creating a safe classroom environment where students derive the joy of learning through collaborative and immersive learning experiences is key. The Start- It- Right programme will give students a good start to the year, allow them to establish a positive school experience and cohesive class culture to have a productive year ahead.

  

2\. Student Well-being Support Framework

  

Student well-being is attended by collaborative effort of different teams which include Pastoral Care and Career Guidance (PCCG), Case Management Team (CMT), House System framework and Student Development Team (SDT). There is a 3-tiered support framework for students to ensure that their needs are met. The first tier intervention is for all students. The other two tiers are for students with additional needs who are supported through programmes and expert intervention such as Allied Educator, Learning Behavioural Support (AED LBS). 

  

The school works closely with external partners to complement the work to support the students’ well-being. The programs provide opportunities for students to be guided by youth volunteers in both academic and social interaction skills. 

  

3\. Kaleidoscope

Another programme that enhances the students’ social emotional competencies would be the Kaleidoscope, a signature programme by Pastoral Care & Career Guidance (PCCG) department. In small group sizes, students get to learn appropriate social skills through games and play, under the guidance of teacher-mentors. Social Skill implementation is a proactive approach that emphasises prevention of behaviour problems through teaching of positive behaviours and the creation of a positive school culture. It also aims to help students achieve positive social, emotional, and academic outcomes in school through direct teaching and reinforcement approaches. 

  

Additionally, the school has embarked on using one of the strategies in Social Skills as a key focus for all levels: Use of Appropriate Voice Level. It is a whole-school focus in instilling the value of care in our students where they use suitable volume when they interact with others at various parts of the school and communities.

#### **Social Skills**


Social Skills package is structured to teach the students at every level based on age-appropriate understanding of social skills suitable for the students. At the end of each level, students would have learnt several social skills from the form teachers and reinforced by all subject teachers. The overall social skill which will be reinforced at all levels is the “Use of Voice Tone”.
