<h4><strong>SIGNATURE PROGRAMMES</strong></h4>
<p>1. Transition Support&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the transition support programme - ‘Start-It-Right’- is an orientation
programme that takes place in the 1st week of the school for all levels.
This programme focuses on providing enriching learning opportunities for
the students to ease well into the new academic year. Through this programme,
teachers will guide students to relate well to others, navigate new social
spaces and adapt themselves to the new social environment amidst new processes
and structures.</p>
<p>At Fuhua, we believe that students learn best when they feel safe and
confident. Creating a safe classroom environment where students derive
the joy of learning through collaborative and immersive learning experiences
is key. The Start- It- Right programme will give students a good start
to the year, allow them to establish a positive school experience and cohesive
class culture to have a productive year ahead.</p>
<p>2. Student Well-being Support Framework</p>
<p>Student well-being is attended by collaborative effort of different teams
which include Pastoral Care and Career Guidance (PCCG), Case Management
Team (CMT), House System framework and Student Development Team (SDT).
There is a 3-tiered support framework for students to ensure that their
needs are met. The first tier intervention is for all students. The other
two tiers are for students with additional needs who are supported through
programmes and expert intervention.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The school works closely with external partners to complement the work
to support the students’ well-being. The programs provide opportunities
for students to be guided by youth volunteers in both academic and social
interaction skills.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Kaleidoscope</p>
<p>Another programme that enhances the students’ social emotional competencies
would be the Kaleidoscope, a signature programme by Pastoral Care &amp;
Career Guidance (PCCG) department. In small group sizes, students get to
learn appropriate social skills through games and play, under the guidance
of teacher-mentors. Social Skill implementation is a proactive approach
that emphasises prevention of behaviour problems through teaching of positive
behaviours and the creation of a positive school culture. It also aims
to help students achieve positive social, emotional, and academic outcomes
in school through direct teaching and reinforcement approaches.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, the school has embarked on using one of the strategies in
Social Skills as a key focus for all levels: Use of Appropriate Voice Level.
It is a whole-school focus in instilling the value of care in our students
where they use suitable volume when they interact with others at various
parts of the school and communities.</p>
<h4><strong>Social Skills</strong></h4>
<p>Social Skills package is structured to teach the students at every level
based on age-appropriate understanding of social skills suitable for the
students. At the end of each level, students would have learnt several
social skills from the form teachers and reinforced by all subject teachers.
The overall social skill which will be reinforced at all levels is the
“Use&nbsp;of Voice Tone”.</p>
