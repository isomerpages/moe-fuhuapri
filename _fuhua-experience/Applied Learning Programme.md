Applied Learning Programme provides meaningful and purposeful age-appropriate opportunities for real-life application of learning. They allow for experimentation, self-discovery and joy of learning. As Fuhua Primary School is the West Zone Centre of Excellence (COE) for ICT in teaching and learning, the school’s focus is on STEAM (Science, Technology, Art, Engineering and Mathematics). 

#### **STUDENT AS DESIGNER FOR THE 21ST CENTURY**


Student As Designer for the 21st Century is a 6-year programme where computational thinking takes centre-stage using coding applications and design thinking protocol to help students to:

1. decomposition – break down a complex problem into smaller, more manageable parts

2. pattern recognition – look for similarities among and within problems

3. abstraction – focus on important information; omitting irrelevant details

4. algorithms – develop a step-by-step solution to the problem; set up rules to follow to solve the problem

  

The table  below shows  how P5 and P6 students may be looking at issues related to Air Transportation and they will be led through a series of discussions, research and using their knowledge learnt in coding of drones to devise solution/s to solve the identified issues / problems.  

  

At the end of P6, student will be able to 

*   Demonstrate 21st Century Competencies through Computational Thinking and Thinking Skills 
*   Develop Problem-Solving Capabilities for the Future
*   Develop ICT skills for the future workforce 
*   Contribute back to the community leveraging on technology
