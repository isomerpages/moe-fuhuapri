<h2>GEM+</h2>
<p>For students to thrive in this fast-changing world, they must be equipped
with the relevant skills and knowledge. Hence, the school curriculum must
be robust and designed with the intent of allowing students to hone these
skills, in particular the 21st century skills. Understanding the current
education demands, FHPS developed The Fuhua GEM+ Programme which aims to
enhance students’ subject domain knowledge, develop transferable skills,
allow students to work collaboratively, strengthen their problem-solving
and self-management skills. The programme places great premium on students’
ability to frame new problems and create new solutions through interdisciplinary
learning and collaboration.</p>
<p>Fuhua GEM+ programme is an initiative that leverages the school’s strength
in the areas of technology, environmental education and values-in-action
programme to create meaningful learning experiences that allows students
to experience interdisciplinary learning in an authentic context. It integrates
the school’s Applied Learning Programme (ALP), Learn for Life Programme
(LLP) and Values-in-Action (VIA) Programme; ALP focuses on solving problem
using tech-enabled solutions, i.e Students use coding as a tool to solve
future problem; LLP aims to develop Eco-Stewards, advocates of sustainable
living who serve and champion good causes in the area of environment; VIA
builds strong character, values and positive attitude among our students.
These are aligned to Fuhua Primary’s student outcomes of Every Fuhua Gem
– Lifelong Learners, Citizen Leaders and Tech-Savvy Innovators.</p>
