![]()The **Learning for Life Programme (LLP)** implemented by MOE focuses on the affective aspect of students’ development. 

  

In Fuhua Primary School, we  aim to develop environmental champions through our LLP. The programme intent and design are aligned to the student outcomes where we aim to nurture them into **Lifelong Learners, Citizen Leaders and Tech-Savvy Innovators.**

  

We develop our Environmental Champions to spearhead and lead environmental efforts through being Ambassadors, Champions and Enthusiasts (ACE). 

  

**As part of Fuhua LLP, activities are planned throughout the year to:**  

*   promote sustainable living and lifestyle habits in our school and the wider community
*   enrich students’ classroom experiences and provide a platform to embark on outreach activities
*   nurture responsible individuals who are active in conserving the environment and enhancing the well-being of the community
*   develop students’ character and values, cultivate positive attitudes and strengthen their people skill, social & emotional competencies through outreach activities and programmes 
*   deepen students’ 21st century competencies through authentic experiences

  

**These activities are aligned to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDG).** 

The following diagram depicts the programmes at the Primary 1 – 6 levels and their alignment to the UN SDG.
