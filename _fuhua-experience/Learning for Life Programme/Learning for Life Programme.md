<p><strong>LEARNING FOR LIFE PROGRAMME @ FHPS - <em>Eco-stewardship</em></strong><em>, </em><strong><em>advocates of sustainable living who serve and lead in bettering the lives of others</em></strong>
</p>
<p>The Learning for Life Programme (LLP) implemented by MOE focuses on the
affective aspect of students’ development.</p>
<p>In Fuhua Primary School, we&nbsp;aim to develop environmental champions
through our LLP. The programme intent and design are aligned to the student
outcomes where we aim to nurture them into&nbsp;<strong>Lifelong Learners, Citizen Leaders and Tech-Savvy Innovators.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>We develop our student leaders to champion environmental
efforts through being <strong>A</strong>mbassadors, <strong>C</strong>hampions
and <strong>E</strong>nthusiasts (ACE).&nbsp;</p>
