Through the House System, we have a school-based leadership programme called the SIXERs. Every student is grouped in a group of six. Each SIXER group comprises of a teacher and one student from each level. The SIXER leaders (P5 and P6 students) act as role models to the Little SIXERs (P1 to P4 students), offering peer support and insights like a family nucleus. It helps to build trust, hone leadership skills and learning on diversity appreciation, empathy and collaboration.
