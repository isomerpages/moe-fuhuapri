The House System serves to build a sense of school identity, family spirit and inculcating schools values amongst students. As such, each house is named after a school value represented by an animal mascot. House Meets are designed to provide opportunities to play, interact with peers of different ages, cultures, religions and races within their Houses. These learning opportunities allow them to collaborate and connect at a deeper level beyond classrooms. Every staff and every student belongs to a House with an identifiable animal mascot and also a School Value where each House is responsible to promoting school-wide activities.
