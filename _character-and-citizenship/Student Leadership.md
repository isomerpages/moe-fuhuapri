At Fuhua, our Student Leadership Development programme is an important aspect of the school’s concerted and continual effort in promoting holistic development of every Fuhua student.&nbsp; As citizens in an increasingly dynamic and interconnected world, it is crucial for Fuhua student to be equipped with necessary skills such as interpersonal, collaborative and communication skills, innovative problem solving, reasoning and decision making skills. These competencies, definitive of effective leadership, will allow them to consider issues from multiple perspectives and enable them to handle complexity and ambiguity with confidence. We strive to develop every student as a Citizen Leader. Thus, prefects serve beyond operational duties and are advocates in promoting a caring and enabling school environment.

The school's Prefectorial Board consists of P3 – P6 students nominated by teachers based on their ability and potential to serve at a higher leadership level. P3 &amp; P4 prefects are nominated as junior prefects while P5 &amp; P6 prefects are elected as senior prefects.

Beyond the expected roles and responsibilities of a prefect, there are ample opportunities for prefects to serve and embody the essence of being a Citizen Leader. The intent is to provide platforms for more student-led initiatives thus promoting greater work collaboration amongst students, as well as being advocates for student voices.
         
##### **Prefects' Training**
The prefects' training allow our leaders to connect and empower one another to make the school a better place for all. It aims to create a positive culture among students and strengthen the support network. During these sessions, prefects were trained to be Peer Support Leaders and were empowered to voice out issues happening on the ground during ***Prefects' Conversations*** time.

##### **Student-Led Initiatives: Yuhua Rice Distribution, Better as Buddies, World Mental Health Day**
FHPS provides students with platforms and opportunities to develop leadership knowledge, skills and values through the three interrelated dimensions of self, team and community leadership. As part of community leadership, our leaders were given the opportunity to organise community events such as the Yuhua Rice Distribution in lieu of Chinese New Year. Students also nurture a caring environment by initiating student campaigns such as Better as Buddies and World Mental Health Day.
