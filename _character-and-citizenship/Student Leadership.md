<p>At Fuhua, our Student Leadership Development programme is an important
aspect of the school’s concerted and continual effort in promoting holistic
development of every Fuhua student.&nbsp; As citizens in an increasingly
dynamic and interconnected world, it is crucial for Fuhua student to be
equipped with necessary skills such as interpersonal, collaborative and
communication skills, innovative problem solving, reasoning and decision-making
skills. These competencies, definitive of effective leadership, will allow
them to consider issues from multiple perspectives and enable them to handle
complexity and ambiguity with confidence. We strive to develop every student
as a Citizen Leader.</p>
<h5><strong>Citizen Leadership Framework</strong></h5>
<p></p>
<h5><strong>refects' Training</strong></h5>
<p>The prefects' training allow our leaders to connect and empower one another
to make the school a better place for all. It aims to create a positive
culture among students and strengthen the support network. During these
sessions, prefects were trained to be Peer Support Leaders and were empowered
to voice out issues happening on the ground during <strong><em>Prefects' Conversations</em></strong> time.</p>
<h5><strong>Student-Led Initiatives: Yuhua Rice Distribution, Better as Buddies, World Mental Health Day</strong></h5>
<p>FHPS provides students with platforms and opportunities to develop leadership
knowledge, skills and values through the three interrelated dimensions
of self, team and community leadership. As part of community leadership,
our leaders were given the opportunity to organise community events such
as the Yuhua Rice Distribution in lieu of Chinese New Year. Students also
nurture a caring environment by initiating student campaigns such as Better
as Buddies and World Mental Health Day.</p>

</p>
<h5><strong>Sixer</strong></h5>
<p>Through the House System, we have a school-based leadership programme
called the SIXERs. Every student is grouped in a group of six. Each SIXER
group comprises of a teacher and one student from each level. The SIXER
leaders (P5 and P6 students) act as role models to the Little SIXERs (P1
to P4 students), offering peer support and insights like a family nucleus.
It helps to build trust, hone leadership skills and learning on diversity
appreciation, empathy and collaboration.</p>

<p>The Sixer Mentor (P6) looks after his or her group comprising of a Sixer
Leader (P5), an Assistant Sixer Leader (P4), a Buddy Leader (P3) and Little
Leaders (P2 and P1). The SIXER Mentors and Leaders are the role models
to the Little SIXERs, offering peer support and insights like a family
nucleus. A SIXER will stay with the same group throughout their 6 years
in FHPS.</p>

<p>The activities conducted during the SIXER meets are based on a school
value and the character trait of the week. For example, the value of RESPECT
and the character trait of the week, <em>“I will ask for forgiveness when I do wrong”</em> will
be the focus during one of the meets.</p>

<p>At the end of each semester, there will be a Sixer bonding session where
all the group members can bring snacks to share with one another and share
their thoughts and reflections and things such as holiday plan and so on.</p>
<h5><strong>Class Committee</strong></h5>
<p>The primary purpose of the Class Committee is to develop leadership skills
at the class level, aiming to instill a strong sense of responsibility
among students. Through this initiative, students are encouraged to take
care of their peers and cultivate a shared class identity, promoting positive
practices within the classroom.</p>
<p>The desired outcome of the Class Committee trainings encompasses three
key aspects:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Instill a strong sense of right and wrong among students, fostering ethical
decision-making</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Encourage students to receive with gratitude and go beyond mere reception
by actively contributing to the class community.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Empower students to serve and lead initiatives that contribute to the
improvement of others' lives.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The training platform facilitates the analysis of daily scenarios that
may arise within the class context. Students engage in discussions, sharing
their ideas on effective ways to manage these situations. These training
sessions play a crucial role in enhancing students' abilities to navigate
and adapt to challenging circumstances. Overall, the Class Committee serves
as a dynamic avenue for fostering leadership, ethical values, and collaborative
problem-solving skills among students.</p>
