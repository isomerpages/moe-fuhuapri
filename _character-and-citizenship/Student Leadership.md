At Fuhua, our Student Leadership Development programme is an important aspect of the school’s concerted and continual effort in promoting holistic development of every Fuhua student.&nbsp; As citizens in an increasingly dynamic and interconnected world, it is crucial for Fuhua student to be equipped with necessary skills such as interpersonal, collaborative and communication skills, innovative problem solving, reasoning and decision making skills. These competencies, definitive of effective leadership, will allow them to consider issues from multiple perspectives and enable them to handle complexity and ambiguity with confidence. We strive to develop every student as a Citizen Leader. Thus, prefects serve beyond operational duties and are advocates in promoting a caring and enabling school environment.

The school's Prefectorial Board consists of P3 – P6 students nominated by teachers based on their ability and potential to serve at a higher leadership level. P3 &amp; P4 prefects are nominated as junior prefects while P5 &amp; P6 prefects are elected as senior prefects.

Beyond the expected roles and responsibilities of a prefect, there are ample opportunities for prefects to serve and embody the essence of being a Citizen Leader. The intent is to provide platforms for more student-led initiatives thus promoting greater work collaboration amongst students, as well as being advocates for student voices.
         
##### **Prefects' Training**
The prefects' training allow our leaders to connect and empower one another to make the school a better place for all. It aims to create a positive culture among students and strengthen the support network. During these sessions, prefects were trained to be Peer Support Leaders and were empowered to voice out issues happening on the ground during ***Prefects' Conversations*** time.

##### **Student-Led Initiatives: Yuhua Rice Distribution, Better as Buddies, World Mental Health Day**
FHPS provides students with platforms and opportunities to develop leadership knowledge, skills and values through the three interrelated dimensions of self, team and community leadership. As part of community leadership, our leaders were given the opportunity to organise community events such as the Yuhua Rice Distribution in lieu of Chinese New Year. Students also nurture a caring environment by initiating student campaigns such as Better as Buddies and World Mental Health Day.

##### **Sixer**
Through the House System, we have a school-based leadership programme called the SIXERs. Every student is grouped in a group of six. Each SIXER group comprises of a teacher and one student from each level. The SIXER leaders (P5 and P6 students) act as role models to the Little SIXERs (P1 to P4 students), offering peer support and insights like a family nucleus. It helps to build trust, hone leadership skills and learning on diversity appreciation, empathy and collaboration.

The SIXER Mentors and Leaders are the role models to the Little SIXERs, offering peer support and insights like a family nucleus. A SIXER will stay with the same group throughout their 6 years in FHPS.

For example, the value of RESPECT and the character trait of the week, _“I will ask for forgiveness when I do wrong”_ will be the focus during one of the meets.

##### **Class Committee**
The primary purpose of the Class Committee is to develop leadership skills at the class level, aiming to instill a strong sense of responsibility among students. Through this initiative, students are encouraged to take care of their peers and cultivate a shared class identity, promoting positive practices within the classroom.

The desired outcome of the Class Committee trainings encompasses three key aspects:
* Instill a strong sense of right and wrong among students, fostering ethical decision-making
* Encourage students to receive with gratitude and go beyond mere reception by actively contributing to the class community.
* Empower students to serve and lead initiatives that contribute to the improvement of others' lives.

The training platform facilitates the analysis of daily scenarios that may arise within the class context. Students engage in discussions, sharing their ideas on effective ways to manage these situations. These training sessions play a crucial role in enhancing students' abilities to navigate and adapt to challenging circumstances. Overall, the Class Committee serves as a dynamic avenue for fostering leadership, ethical values, and collaborative problem-solving skills among students.

Our citizen leaders must empathize with the individuals involved and determine their subsequent course of action.
