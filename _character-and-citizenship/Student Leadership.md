At Fuhua, our Student Leadership Development programme is an important aspect of the school’s concerted and continual effort in promoting holistic development of every Fuhua student.  As citizens in an increasingly dynamic and interconnected world, it is crucial for Fuhua student to be equipped with necessary skills such as interpersonal, collaborative and communication skills, innovative problem solving, reasoning and decision making skills. These competencies, definitive of effective leadership, will allow them to consider issues from multiple perspectives and enable them to handle complexity and ambiguity with confidence. We strives to develop every student as a Citizen Leader. 

#### **STUDENT LEADERSHIP APPROACH**

Fuhua aims to nurture Citizen Leaders. Our student leadership approach is undergirded by J.C Maxwell’s Servant Leadership Framework. At Fuhua, we believe that the heart of leadership is serving others first, before self. Students will experience learning opportunities to develop and acquire social and leadership skills through explicit teaching which will reinforce and facilitate the application of learning through several programmes. With appropriate training and mentoring, and platforms for practice, application and reflection, the school aims to achieve the desired leadership outcomes for all students to be Citizen Leaders. In designing our Student Leadership programme, we anchor on these three beliefs:-  

  

**a) Every student has the potential to grow as a leader**

Every student is capable of leading self and others to make positive contributions to improve class, school, and the community at large. With each student’s unique strengths and interests, every individual is able to make a positive difference within his or her sphere of influence, thus making them leaders in their own right. Therefore, we strive to provide platforms for students to hone their personal and leadership beliefs and henceforth grow in leadership potential whilst staying grounded in sound values.

  

**b) Leadership is a journey, not a destination**

We believe that leadership is a continuous process of self-reflection and development. With the learning opportunities provided at Fuhua, we believe our student leaders will  develop self-insights, self-regulation and self-identity and be able to make sound and ethical decisions. 

  

**c) Leadership development needs to be intentional**  

While incidental leadership learning can occur across all platforms, intentional student leadership development will ensure that students are equipped with the requisite competencies for effective leadership. The school ensures that leadership training and developmental opportunities are carefully mapped out to ensure that leadership competencies, both fundamental and advanced, are made explicit to the students.
