<p>After a long hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Fuhua relaunched its <em>Trips for Internationalisation Experience (TIE) Program</em> in
2024. This unique initiative is designed to nurture global leaders by developing
students' 21st-century competencies (21CC), with a focus on global awareness,
cross-cultural skills, and sensitivity. The program aligns closely with
the <strong>CCE 2021 Intent</strong> to help students:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Understand Singapore’s ties with Asia and the Southeast Asian region.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recognize how Singapore’s cultural heritage has been shaped by diverse
influences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Appreciate the cultural and economic interdependence between Singapore
and other Southeast Asian countries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Foster civic consciousness by considering Singapore’s connection to the
region and the world.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In 2024, Fuhua successfully established a strong partnership with Tungmahamek
School in Bangkok, Thailand, marking an important milestone in our international
engagement efforts. The TIE Program offers students opportunities for <em>learning beyond borders</em>,
where they can establish friendships and build networks with like-minded
peers who share a passion for sustainability.</p>
