<p>After a long hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Fuhua relaunched its <em>Trips for Internationalisation Experience (TIE) Program</em> in
2024. This unique initiative is designed to nurture global leaders by developing
students' 21st-century competencies (21CC), with a focus on global awareness,
cross-cultural skills, and sensitivity. The program aligns closely with
the <strong>CCE 2021 Intent</strong> to help students:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Understand Singapore’s ties with Asia and the Southeast Asian region.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recognize how Singapore’s cultural heritage has been shaped by diverse
influences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Appreciate the cultural and economic interdependence between Singapore
and other Southeast Asian countries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Foster civic consciousness by considering Singapore’s connection to the
region and the world.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In 2024, Fuhua successfully established a strong partnership with Tungmahamek
School in Bangkok, Thailand, marking an important milestone in our international
engagement efforts. The TIE Program offers students opportunities for <em>learning beyond borders</em>,
where they can establish friendships and build networks with like-minded
peers who share a passion for sustainability.</p>

<p>The program begins with virtual exchanges, such as a Chinese New Year
cultural sharing with Thai peers, allowing students to develop an appreciation
for diverse traditions before embarking on an overseas learning experience.
During the trip, students participate in cultural immersion activities
and collaborate on global issues such as sustainability. They also engage
in hands-on learning with their Thai peers, including making flowers using
pandan leaves, learning about food production in farm, and discovering
the process of rice cultivation and Thai methods of cooking. Students also
enjoy traditional Thai cuisine, deepening their cross-cultural appreciation.</p>

<p>Additionally, students share their creative projects they embarked in
school such as solar-powered lamps, designed to promote eco-friendly practices
and raise awareness about sustainable energy solutions with their counterparts.
These projects encourage students to think creatively and apply their knowledge
of sustainability in real-world contexts. By designing and showcasing such
practices, students not only reinforce their commitment to environmental
responsibility but also learn how innovative solutions can contribute to
a greener, more sustainable future. This hands-on experience fosters a
sense of ownership and pride in their ability to make a positive impact
to the world around them.</p>

<p>As part of post-trip, students continue their engagement with their Thai
counterparts through online exchange, deepening their understanding of
sustainable practices while reinforcing connections to the Primary 5 Social
Studies curriculum. By integrating pre-trip preparation, hands-on cultural
immersion, and post-trip reflection, the TIE Program equips students with
the skills and mindset to navigate in an interconnected world.</p>

<p>Through structured and sustained engagement, Fuhua’s TIE Program offers
students meaningful cross-cultural experiences that go beyond the confines
of a single overseas trip. This ongoing learning experience helps students
to develop an appreciation for regional diversity, encouraging them to
embrace different cultures, perspectives, and ways of life. By exploring
Southeast Asia’s rich cultural and social landscape, students also gain
a deeper understanding of Singapore’s pivotal role in the region, both
historically and in the present day.</p>
<p>By empowering students with these essential skills and experiences, Fuhua’s
TIE Program not only nurtures global awareness but also fosters amongst
students a sense of responsibility and purpose. It equips students with
the tools to navigate and contribute to an interconnected world, where
they can lead with empathy, creativity, and a commitment to sustainability.
In doing so, the program aims to cultivate a generation of responsible
global citizens, ready to make a meaningful and lasting impact on the world.</p>
