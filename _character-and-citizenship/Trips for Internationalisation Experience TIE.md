The TIE Programme aims to develop our students with the 21 Century Competencies of Global Awareness and Cross-Cultural Skills which will enable them to develop cultural sensitivities. It exposes students to Asia with a greater focus on ASEAN countries and sensitises them to the place of Singapore in the world. It also helps to strengthen studentsâ€™ commitment and rootedness to Singapore.

THE TIE EXPERIENCE
------------------

In 2019, a group of Primary 5 students went on a trip to Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam. They went through experiences such as farming, making traditional crafts, visiting the local war museum. They had the opportunity to interact with local students with hearing and speech impairment. During the trip, they learnt about the way of life of Vietnamese, their culture and history and the relation and ties between Singapore and Vietnam.
