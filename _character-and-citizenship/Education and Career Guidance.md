<p>At Fuhua Primary School, Education and Career Guidance (ECG) equips students
with the necessary knowledge, skills, and values to make informed decisions
at key education milestones. Through ECG, students explore their interests,
abilities, and passion, helping them to develop a stronger sense of self-identity
and direction. Through ECG lessons and experiences, complemented by the
MySkillsFuture Student Portal, students are empowered to make informed
education and career choices and are prepared for lifelong learning. By
exploring diverse pathways and learning to value all occupations, they
develop adaptability, resilience, and the motivation to take proactive
steps toward achieving their aspirations.</p>

<p><strong><u>Our Approach</u></strong>
</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>FTGP lessons:</strong> ECG
lessons have been incorporated into the Form-Teacher Guidance Periods (FTGP)
package, covering a range of topics that help students discover their interests,
strengths, and career aspirations. These lessons also enhance students’
understanding of the secondary education landscape, enabling them to set
informed goals for their secondary school choices. Students can further
explore and reflect on these goals by tapping on the MySkillsFuture portal,
which complements their FTGP lessons and supports them in planning their
educational journey.</p>
