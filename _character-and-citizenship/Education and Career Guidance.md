<p>At Fuhua Primary School, Education and Career Guidance (ECG) equips students
with the necessary knowledge, skills, and values to make informed decisions
at key education milestones. Through ECG, students explore their interests,
abilities, and passion, helping them to develop a stronger sense of self-identity
and direction. Through ECG lessons and experiences, complemented by the
MySkillsFuture Student Portal, students are empowered to make informed
education and career choices and are prepared for lifelong learning. By
exploring diverse pathways and learning to value all occupations, they
develop adaptability, resilience, and the motivation to take proactive
steps toward achieving their aspirations.</p>
