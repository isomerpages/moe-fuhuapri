<p>In FHPS, NE learning experiences are based on the Citizenry Framework.
We aim to develop Citizen Leaders through the four key dispositions of
NE (A Sense of Belonging, A Sense of Reality, A Sense of Hope and The Will
to Act) through various opportunities to explore and examine their identity
as Singaporeans or their identity as local residents for non-Singaporeans.
NE learning experiences foster a strong sense of belonging, reality, and
hope in our students. With that strong fundamentals, we strive for students
who will understand the need to play a contributory role in their immediate
communities and in the nation while seeking to achieve their personal life
goals.</p>

<h4><strong><u>Social Studies Learning Journey</u></strong></h4>
<p>Every year, as part of the Primary 4, 5 and 6 Social Studies curriculum,
a new cohort of students embarks on exciting learning journeys to Kreta
Ayer Heritage Centre (KAHC), Indian Heritage Centre (IHC) and Asian Civilisation
Museum (ACM) respectively. These immersive experiences offer our Fuhua
GEMS a valuable opportunity to explore the rich history of Singapore.</p>

</p>
<p>During the visit, students discover real-life stories of influential members
of the Kreta Ayer community and learn about their pivotal roles in nation-building.
Through these stories, they gain a deeper understanding of their significant
contributions to the development of our multicultural Singapore.</p>
<p>As part of the experience, students immerse themselves in the cultural
heart of Chinatown, gaining a unique insight into the area's history and
diverse traditions. They engage in hands-on activities, exploring five
key cultural forms that are integral to the area: Chinese opera, puppetry,
calligraphy, tea culture, and Nanyin music. These activities allow students
to connect with the traditions that have shaped Kreta Ayer's identity.</p>
<p>The learning journey also includes a precinct walk, where students have
the chance to explore the iconic shophouses that line the streets. Here,
they learn about the historical significance of places like Sago Lane,
once known for its special role in the community. This exploration helps
students make meaningful connections to the cultural heritage of Kreta
Ayer and appreciate the lasting impact it has had on the multicultural
fabric of Singapore.</p>
