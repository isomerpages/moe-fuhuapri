In FHPS, NE learning experiences are based on the Citizenry Framework. We aim to develop Citizen Leaders through the four key dispositions of NE (A Sense of Belonging, A Sense of Reality, A Sense of Hope and The Will to Act) through various opportunities to explore and examine their identity as Singaporeans or their identity as local residents for non-Singaporeans. NE learning experiences foster a strong sense of belonging, reality, and hope in our students. With that strong fundamentals, we strive for students who will understand the need to play a contributory role in their immediate communities and in the nation while seeking to achieve their personal life goals.

#### **NE AMBASSADORS PROGRAMME**


NE Ambassadors are a selected group of students who show passion and interest in National Education. They undergo the NE Ambassadors Badge Programme with Singapore Discovery Centre to widen and deepen their knowledge in areas such as key messages in National Education and hone their skills in public speaking and presentation. They also go on exclusive learning journeys and share their learning with the rest of the school during assemblies. Part of their training plans also include leading the heritage trails around the school.
