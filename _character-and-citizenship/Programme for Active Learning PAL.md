<p>At Fuhua, all Primary 1 and Primary 2 students undergo PAL modules during
school hours. With these modules spread over two years, we hope to nurture
our students with the learning experiences of 4 Cs (Confidence, Creativity,
Collaboration and Critical Thinking) and Social Emotional skills via the
four PAL Domains:-</p>

<p>Performing Arts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sports and Games</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Visual Arts</p>

<li>
<p>Outdoor Education</p>

</ol>
<h4><strong>PAL APPROACH</strong></h4>
<p>PAL lessons allow experiential learning and provide opportunities for
students to learn in a creative environment and be creative in their imagination
while incorporating social emotional skills in a fun and enjoyable learning
environment.</p>
