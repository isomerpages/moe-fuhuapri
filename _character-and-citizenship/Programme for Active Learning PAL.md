At Fuhua, all Primary 1 and Primary 2 students undergo PAL modules during school hours. With these modules spread over two years, we hope to nurture our students with the learning experiences of 4 Cs (Confidence, Creativity, Collaboration and Critical Thinking) and Social Emotional skills via the four PAL Domains:-

1.  Performing Arts
2.  Sports and Games
3.  Visual ArtsÂ 
4.  Outdoor Education

  

#### **PAL APPROACH**


PAL lessons allow experiential learning and provide opportunities for students to learn in a creative environment and be creative in their imagination while incorporating social emotional skills in a fun and enjoyable learning environment.
