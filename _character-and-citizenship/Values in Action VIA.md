#### **VIA APPROACH**


1.  Awareness – Students will be provided with authentic learning experiences to heighten their sense of empathy as they put others before self and take ownership in their own social-emotional development
2.  Attitude  – Students are exposed to current problems/issues and perceive them as opportunities and ideate solutions creatively using Design Thinking
3.  Action – Students are provided with opportunities to put the values learned into actions and be the leader to make a difference in the lives of others by serving their family and community

#### **VIA PROGRAMME**


VIA Programme @ FHPS promotes socio-cultural diversity, social cohesion, harmony and active citizenry by involving students from P3 to P6 in a series of programme. 

  

The programme looks into bringing authentic experiences where the learning the value of empathy will be at its best. The programme revolves around the themes on Caring for My Family and School, Reaching out and Giving Back to the Community. As such, FHPS works very closely with other Voluntary Welfare Organizations (VWOs). An example is where we focus on Care for the Elderly, we reach out to various agencies, such as HCA, FILOs Community Services, NEA, HCA and HDB to provide meaningful experiences for our students whilst at the same, allowing them to give back to the community.
