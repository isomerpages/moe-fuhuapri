<p>At Fuhua, our Student Leadership Development programme is an important
aspect of the school‚Äôs concerted and continual effort in promoting holistic
development of every Fuhua student.&nbsp; As citizens in an increasingly
dynamic and interconnected world, it is crucial for Fuhua student to be
equipped with necessary skills such as interpersonal, collaborative and
communication skills, innovative problem solving, reasoning and decision-making
skills. These competencies, definitive of effective leadership, will allow
them to consider issues from multiple perspectives and enable them to handle
complexity and ambiguity with confidence. We strive to develop every student
as a Citizen Leader.</p>
<h4><strong>Citizen Leadership Framework</strong></h4>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Fuhua Experience/Student Development/Character &amp; Citizenship/Student Leadership/citizen_framework.jpg">
</div>
<p>Citizen Leadership Framework at Fuhua Primary School takes reference from
the existing MOE‚Äôs 3-interrelated-dimensions of self, team and community
leadership as well as Lickona‚Äôs and Davidson‚Äôs Performance Character and
Moral Character. The framework aims to enhance clarity on how these fundamental
ideas are able to form the core areas of citizen leaders to embody the
guiding principle of ‚ÄúÈ•ÆÊ∞¥ÊÄùÊ∫ê‚Äù through their experiences where they receive
and serve with grateful hearts.</p>
<h4><strong>Prefectorial Board</strong></h4>
<p>The school's Prefectorial Board consists of P3 ‚Äì P6 students nominated
by teachers based on their ability and potential to serve at a higher leadership
level. P3 &amp; P4 prefects are nominated as junior prefects while P5 &amp;
P6 prefects are elected as senior prefects.</p>
<p>Beyond the expected roles and responsibilities of a prefect, there are
ample opportunities for prefects to serve and embody the essence of being
a Citizen Leader. The intent is to provide platforms for more student-led
initiatives thus promoting greater work collaboration amongst students,
as well as being advocates for student voices.</p>
<p><strong>Prefects' Meet</strong>
</p>
<p>The prefects' meet allow our leaders to connect and empower one another
to make the school a better place for all. It aims to create a positive
culture among students and strengthen the support network. During these
sessions, prefects were trained to be Peer Support Leaders and were empowered
to voice out issues happening on the ground during&nbsp;<strong><em>Prefects' Conversations</em></strong>&nbsp;time.</p>
<p><strong>Student-Led Initiatives: Yuhua Rice Distribution, Students Suggestions, Better as Buddies, World Mental Health Day</strong>
</p>
<p>Fuhua provides students with platforms and opportunities to develop leadership
knowledge, skills and values through the three interrelated dimensions
of self, team and community leadership. As part of community leadership,
our leaders were given the opportunity to organise community events such
as the Yuhua Rice Distribution as part of Chinese New Year celebrations.
Students also nurture a caring environment and advocate for student voices
by initiating student campaigns such as Better as Buddies, World Mental
Health Day and I Wish, I Wish.</p>

<p><strong><u>Affirmation Certificates</u></strong>
</p>
<p>As Term 1 came to a close, the Tier 2 Citizen Leaders took the opportunity
to recognise the resilience and adaptability of our Primary 1 students.
Transitioning into primary school is a significant milestone, and our P1
Fuhua Gems demonstrated great effort in embracing new routines and challenges.
üí™</p>
<p>Piloted in 2024 by the prefects, this initiative was expanded this year
to include House Captains, CCA Leaders, and the Prefectorial Board after
they successfully completed their Peer Support Leader module.</p>
<p>Each P1 Fuhua Gem received a Certificate of Recognition, highlighting
their admirable qualities. The certificates were presented to them on the
last week of Term 1.</p>

<p><strong><u>Recess Activities</u></strong>
</p>
<p>In addition to the certificate presentation, our newly appointed EXCO
team successfully introduced their first initiative by organising recess
activities that were led by senior prefects for our P1 Fuhua Gems. This
took place during the P1 and P4 recess.</p>
<p><strong>‚Ä¢ Affirmation Photo Booth Station: </strong>As part of this initiative,
a group of Primary 4 prefects managed an affirmation photo booth station,
where they shared positive messages with the P1 students and captured their
pictures using iPads.</p>

<p><strong><u>P6 Affirmation Cards</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The Prefectorial Board introduced a new initiative to affirm and encourage
Primary 6 students as they prepared for their PSLE. Prefects crafted handwritten
cards featuring beloved Disney characters to inspire their seniors, with
messages created during the Fuhua Kind-dom initiative and prefects' meetings
in Term 3, reflecting Fuhua‚Äôs strong community spirit.</p>

<p><strong>Sixer</strong>
</p>
<p>Through the House System, we have a school-based leadership programme
called the SIXERs. Every student is grouped in a group of six. Each SIXER
group comprises of a teacher and one student from each level. The SIXER
leaders (P5 and P6 students) act as role models to the Little SIXERs (P1
to P4 students), offering peer support and insights like a family nucleus.
It helps to build trust, hone leadership skills and learning on diversity
appreciation, empathy and collaboration.</p>

<p>The Sixer Mentor (P6) looks after his or her group comprising of a Sixer
Leader (P5), an Assistant Sixer Leader (P4), a Buddy Leader (P3) and Little
Leaders (P2 and P1). The SIXER Mentors and Leaders are the role models
to the Little SIXERs, offering peer support and insights like a family
nucleus. A SIXER will stay with the same group throughout their 6 years
in FHPS.</p>
<p>The activities conducted during the SIXER meets are based on a school
value and the character trait of the week. For example, the value of RESPECT
and the character trait of the week,&nbsp;<em>‚ÄúI will ask for forgiveness when I do wrong‚Äù</em>&nbsp;will
be the focus during one of the meets.</p>

<p><strong>CCA Leaders</strong>
</p>
<p>The CCA Leader plays a key role in guiding and supporting their co-curricular
group by working closely with teachers and peers to plan activities, build
team spirit, and lead by example. They help coordinate events, mentor members,
and foster a positive and inclusive environment within the CCA.</p>
<p>In 2024, CCA Leaders collaborated with ActiveSG in inter-generational
games, creating meaningful bonds with senior citizens from Loving Hearts.
Senior Sports Day at the OCBC Arena was a memorable experience for us as
our leaders guided and interacted with the seniors, all while promoting
the importance of staying active.</p>

<p><strong>House Captain</strong>
</p>
<p>The House Captain leads their house by encouraging participation, teamwork,
and school spirit. Our House Captains took pride in contributing to Yuhua
CC's National Day celebrations by leading a session of Nostalgic Singapore

<p><strong>Class Committee</strong>
</p>
<p>The primary purpose of the Class Committee is to develop leadership skills
at the class level, aiming to instil a strong sense of responsibility among
students. Through this initiative, students are encouraged to take care
of their peers and cultivate a shared class identity, promoting positive
practices within the classroom.</p>
<p>The desired outcome of the Class Committee trainings encompasses three
key aspects:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Instil a strong sense of right and wrong among students, fostering ethical
decision-making</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Encourage students to receive with gratitude and go beyond mere reception
by actively contributing to the class community.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Empower students to serve and lead initiatives that contribute to the
improvement of others' lives.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The training platform facilitates the analysis of daily scenarios that
may arise within the class context. Students engage in discussions, sharing
their ideas on effective ways to manage these situations. These training
sessions play a crucial role in enhancing students' abilities to navigate
and adapt to challenging circumstances. Overall, the Class Committee serves
as a dynamic avenue for fostering leadership, ethical values, and collaborative
problem-solving skills among students.</p>
<p>At the beginning of each semester, class chairpersons and vice-chairpersons
come together for a training session designed to gently ease them into
their roles. Through relatable daily scenarios that involve common challenges,
they are encouraged to empathize with others, reflect thoughtfully, and
explore possible ways to respond. These conversations are then shared in
groups, creating a warm space for mutual learning and shared insights.</p>
