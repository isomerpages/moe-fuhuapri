<p>At Fuhua Primary School, we are committed to creating a welcoming and
inclusive environment for International and Permanent Resident (IS/PR)
students through a comprehensive and structured three-year integration
approach. This initiative is designed to ensure that every IS/PR student
feels a strong sense of belonging and is equipped to form meaningful relationships
with their peers. Our approach aims to create a seamless transition into
the school community, where students not only integrate socially but also
thrive academically and personally.</p>

<p>We achieve this through a variety of thoughtfully designed initiatives:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Promoting Cultural Understanding:</strong> Carefully curated learning
journeys were designed to significant community sites such as the Jurong
Heritage Trail and the Singapore River, where students gain firsthand knowledge
of Singapore’s rich history, diverse culture, and social norms. These experiences
allow students to connect with the nation’s heritage while fostering a
deeper understanding of their new home.</p>

<p><strong>Facilitating Friendships and Shared Experiences:</strong> We encourage
meaningful interactions among students through engaging interaction sessions,
especially during key events like International Friendship Day and National
Education (NE) activities. During these occasions, IS/PR students actively
participate in discussions, cultural exchange, and collaborative learning,
helping to forge lasting friendships and build a supportive peer network.</p>

<p><strong>Creating an Inclusive Environment:</strong> IS/PR students are
seamlessly integrated into school-wide activities and community events,
such as the Mid-Autumn Festival and National Day celebrations at the Yuhua
Community Club. These activities provide students with the opportunity
to connect with the broader community, expanding their social circles beyond
the classroom and celebrating Singapore’s multicultural spirit.</p>

<p><strong>Developing Citizen Leaders:</strong> We place great emphasis on
nurturing responsible and socially engaged global citizens. By encouraging
IS/PR students and their families to take an active role in school life,
we strengthen the bond between home and school. Through our Parent Support
Group (PSG), we invite IS/PR parents to engage in school activities, fostering
a sense of community involvement and encouraging contributions that benefit
both the school and the wider society.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Through these initiatives, we empower our students to embrace and celebrate
diversity, foster a sense of unity and social cohesion, and nurture their
growth as globally aware and socially responsible individuals. By encouraging
open-mindedness, collaboration, and respect for different cultures and
perspectives, we equip our students with the skills and values necessary
to thrive in an interconnected world and make meaningful contributions
to society.</p>
