#### **THE CYBER WELLNESS FRAMEWORK**

The CW framework is used to equip students with the knowledge and skills to harness the power of ICT for positive purposes, maintain a positive presence in cyberspace and be safe and responsible users of ICT.  

These are the key messages which students will understand:

* Embrace the affordances of technology while maintaining a balanced lifestyle between offline and online activities
* Be a safe and responsible user of technology and maintain a positive online presence
* Be responsible for personal well-being in the cyberspace

#### **CYBER WELLNESS PROGRAMME**


**Assembly Talks**

Assembly talks emphasise the importance of SENSE-THINK-ACT in their cyberspace interactions. Students are engaged in case studies discussions and sharing of Cyber wellness and New Media Literacies messages via resources such as slides and videos created by CW Advocates (Infocomm Club members) Students-created resources allow CW Advocates to communicate CW & NML messages effectively from the students’ viewpoint to their peers.

  

**CW Trails**

With iPad in hand, the students scanned the QR codes placed in different parts of the classroom for the Cyber Wellness trail. This trail is a learning trail done in class where students worked as a team to complete case study discussions and quizzes for them to apply what they had learned. 

  

**SLS lessons**

SLS lessons with e-book reading activity and quizzes are assigned to the students as supplementary reading and to check their understanding on what was shared in Assembly and Circle Time that week.

  

**Cyber Wellness E-newsletter**

The objectives of the Cyber Wellness E-newsletters are to keep parents in the know of the CW activities in school, and to empower parents with knowledge and skills so that they can support student’s positive Cyber Wellness experience at home.
