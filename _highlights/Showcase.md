<h5><strong>ECG Day 2024</strong></h5>
<p>As part of our Education and Career Guidance (ECG) efforts, Primary 1
to Primary 5 students participated in fun and interactive lessons to explore
education pathways and future careers. The programme began with a talk
by Ms Lum Lai Mung, a Senior ECG Counsellor, who shared what ECG is about,
its key goals, and inspired students to think about how they can achieve
their aspirations.</p>

<p>This career talk set the tone for the day and was followed by classroom-based
lesson packages designed to spark curiousity about the world of work and
encourage students to reflect on their dreams. Through engaging discussions,
hands-on activities, and virtual experiences, students gained a deeper
understanding of what lies ahead after primary school and were motivated
to think about the possibilities for their future.</p>

<p>The Primary 6 students attended a separate ECG talk, focusing on the MySkillsFuture
Student Portal. They were introduced to features such as the Education
Guide, the World of Work section, and the Career Quest game. Following
the talk, they participated in a hands-on session using iPads to explore
the portal further and reflect on their interests and possible pathways
ahead.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To continue reflecting on their aspirations, students were also encouraged
to think about what they would like to become when they grow up. Here is
a video of some students sharing what they hope to be in the future.</p>

<h5><strong>P2 Speech &amp; Drama</strong></h5>
<p>Our Primary 2 Drama Programme at Fuhua Primary ignites creativity and
imagination into our young learners through engaging and interactive activities.

self-confidence and communication skills. The programme fosters teamwork,
and personal growth, culminating in an end-of-term performance that showcases
their talents. We are proud to present to you our P2 students' artistic

<h5><strong>Primary 5 Camp</strong></h5>
<p>In January, our Primary 5 students had a meaningful time participating
in a 3D2N camp. The camp aims to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>equip students to adapt to a dynamic environment,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>create opportunities to lead and serve and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>transform students into the best version of themselves.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It has been an enriching experience for our students and will definitely
be one of the highlights of their Primary 5 learning experience. Click
