<h5><strong>ECG Day 2024</strong></h5>
<p>As part of our Education and Career Guidance (ECG) efforts, Primary 1
to Primary 5 students participated in fun and interactive lessons to explore
education pathways and future careers. The programme began with a talk
by Ms Lum Lai Mung, a Senior ECG Counsellor, who shared what ECG is about,
its key goals, and inspired students to think about how they can achieve
their aspirations.</p>

<p>&nbsp;This career talk set the tone for the day and was followed by classroom-based
lesson packages designed to spark curiousity about the world of work and
encourage students to reflect on their dreams. Through engaging discussions,
hands-on activities, and virtual experiences, students gained a deeper
understanding of what lies ahead after primary school and were motivated
to think about the possibilities for their future.</p>

<p>The Primary 6 students attended a separate ECG talk, focusing on the MySkillsFuture
Student Portal. They were introduced to features such as the Education
Guide, the World of Work section, and the Career Quest game. Following
the talk, they participated in a hands-on session using iPads to explore
the portal further and reflect on their interests and possible pathways
ahead.</p>

<h4><strong>Careers Day 2024</strong></h4>
<p>In 2024, our Primary 6 students took part in their very first Careers
Day, an inspiring initiative designed to help them explore their potential,
discover future career paths, and gain insights from industry professionals.
The event aimed to broaden their understanding of diverse job roles and
guide them in uncovering their sense of purpose.</p>

<p>To honour student voice and choice, students were invited to select their
preferred industry professionals for engagement prior to Careers Day 2024.
Based on their feedback, 9 industry professionals were invited to share
their career journeys in concurrent sessions.</p>

<p>Through engaging conversations, students deepened their understanding
of the working world and were inspired to set clear goals and take ownership
of their learning. Their thoughtful questions reflected genuine curiosity
about the speakersâ€™ motivations and career journeys.</p>

<p>Following the engagement sessions, students worked through specially curated
activity booklets, reflecting on the talks they attended and reviewing
their notes. They also completed a career interest survey, helping them
better understand their values, interests, and current as well as aspirational
skills. This encouraged deeper reflection on their personal growth and
future pathways.</p>

<h5><strong>Primary 5 Camp</strong></h5>
<p>In January, our Primary 5 students had a meaningful time participating
in a 3D2N camp. The camp aims to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>equip students to adapt to a dynamic environment,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>create opportunities to lead and serve and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>transform students into the best version of themselves.</p>
