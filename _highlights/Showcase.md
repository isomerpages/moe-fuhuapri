<h5><strong>P2 Speech &amp; Drama</strong></h5>
<p>Our Primary 2 Drama Programme at Fuhua Primary ignites creativity and
imagination into our young learners through engaging and interactive activities.
Students explore role-playing, storytelling, and expressive movement, developing
self-confidence and communication skills. The programme fosters teamwork,
and personal growth, culminating in an end-of-term performance that showcases
their talents. We are proud to present to you our P2 students' artistic
journeys and celebrate their holistic development.</p>

<h5><strong>Primary 5 Camp</strong></h5>
<p>In January, our Primary 5 students had a meaningful time participating
in a 3D2N camp. The camp aims to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>equip students to adapt to a dynamic environment,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>create opportunities to lead and serve and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>transform students into the best version of themselves.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It has been an enriching experience for our students and will definitely
be one of the highlights of their Primary 5 learning experience. Click
