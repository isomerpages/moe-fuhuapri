##### **2024 Primary 5 Camp**
In January, our Primary 5 students had a meaningful time participating in a 3D2N camp. The camp objectives were to:
* equip students to adapt to a dynamic environment, 
* create opportunities to lead and serve and
* transform students into the best version of themselves.


It was a truly enriching experience for our students and will definitely be one of the highlights of their Primary 5 learning experience. Click on the link below to catch a glimpse of this memorable camp.
