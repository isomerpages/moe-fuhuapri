##### **2024 Primary 5 Camp**
In January, our Primary 5 students had a meaningful time participating in a 3D2N camp. 
The camp aims to:
* equip them to adapt to a dynamic environment, 
* create opportunities to lead and serve and
* transform into the best version of themselves.

##### **11th National Primary Schools Photography Competition**

Fuhua Primary School proudly presents the 11th National Primary Schools Photography Competition. Since 2011, Fuhua Primary has been organising the yearly competition (with a two-year hiatus in 2020 and 2021).

The choice of the theme for the competition is in line with the conservation and green movement efforts of the school. This year’s theme is “**BUILDING A CITY OF GREEN POSSIBILITIES TOGETHER**”. &nbsp;

**The objectives of the competition are:**

*   To raise primary school students’ awareness to the Singapore Green Plan 2030 on sustainable development.
*   To provide a platform for primary school students to practice eco-stewardship through the medium of photography.

The competition is open to all MOE Primary schools.&nbsp;&nbsp; The competition will be judged through 4 categories: Open, Budding Photographers, Photojournalism and People’s Choice.
