##### **Innergy Award 2021**


Our project, “ABCs of Engagement for Home-Based Learning”, has won the bronze award for the 2021 MOE Innergy winning projects – Schools (T&L).

The project was initiated to ensure that students’ learning and engagement are not compromised during FHBL. The school set up a HBL organization structure supported by the IP HODs, ICT Team and SDT to coordinate the implementation of HBL with focal areas on curriculum, ICT support and training as well as checking in on the students’ financial and well-being. It is really heartening to know that our response to FHBL is being recognised. 

##### **Community in Bloom Award 2021**


Our community garden in Fuhua Primary School has achieved the Diamond Award and Platinum banding. The Diamond Award is presented to community gardens that have achieved three Platinum bandings. Fuhua Primary School is one of the fourteen community gardens to attain the Diamond Award in 2021.

Launched in May 2005, the Community in Bloom nationwide gardening movement aims to foster a community spirit and bring together residents, both young and old, to make Singapore our City in Nature.

The Community in Bloom (CIB) Awards recognize excellence in gardening efforts by community groups and aims to encourage community gardeners to improve the standards of their gardens while continuing to enjoy gardening as a fun and healthy activity.
