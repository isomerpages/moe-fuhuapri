<h5><strong>Innergy Award 2021</strong></h5>
<p>Our project, “ABCs of Engagement for Home-Based Learning”, has won the

are not compromised during FHBL. The school set up a HBL organization structure
supported by the IP HODs, ICT Team and SDT to coordinate the implementation
of HBL with focal areas on curriculum, ICT support and training as well
as checking in on the students’ financial and well-being. It is really
heartening to know that our response to FHBL is being recognised.</p>

as a fun and healthy activity.</p>
