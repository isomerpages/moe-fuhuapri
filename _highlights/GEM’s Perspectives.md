<h4><strong><u>Kindergarten Tour Experience</u></strong></h4>
<p>Recently, some P4 prefects had a chance to bring Kindergarten 2 (K2) students
from preschools in Jurong East around the school. We were privileged to
show them the school to have an experience as a life of a Primary 1 student.&nbsp;I
was very happy when I was given this task as I can contribute to the society
and help them overcome challenges when entering a new school.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the visit, I was assigned as a student docent to guide K2 students
around our school. Firstly, we gathered at the Tinker Lab, where we were
assigned to different groups. We introduced ourselves to the K2 students.
Then, we headed to the library where we showed them different genres of
books.</p>
<p>Next, we headed to the courtyard, where we told them the importance of
the lightning risk alert and that we have to be careful when playing. After
that, we went to the bookshop where the K2 students’ jaws dropped at the
sight of many interesting items to buy. We told them that they had to be
careful of what they bought as we do not want them to waste money.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Finally, we went to the canteen. We settled the kindergarteners
down at a table which was assigned to us and they put their water bottles
down. Then, we each took two or three K2 students and explained to them
what was sold at each store. They were in a dilemma as they could not decide
on what they should buy with the limited amount of money. After buying
their food, we sat down at the assigned table and chatted with them on
the things they will do or experience when they are in primary school.</p>
<p>I enjoyed the part about bringing the kindergarteners to the canteen to
buy food. The kindergarteners were the most excited when we brought them
to buy food.</p>
<p>If I had another chance, I would definitely agree to be a student docent
again as I felt a sense of accomplishment bringing the kindergarteners
around the school. From this new experience, I learnt that patience is
key to understand the younger ones. They might not understand the words
we used and they would ask questions. We have to be patient when answering
them and not brush them off. We have to treat others the way we want to
be treated.</p>

<p>During the kindergarten tour, my friends and I brought Kindergarten 2
(K2) students around the school as we explained to them the school rules.</p>
<p>When we brought the K2 students to the canteen, they had a chance to try
the food there. When we brought them to the bookshop, they were excited
after seeing the beautiful stationery and books. We also brought them to
other places such as the courtyard where we taught them about safety rules
while playing. Next, we went to the hall where we told them about our morning
assembly. Their favorite part of the tour was when we brought them to the
library. We saw them gasp in disbelief when they felt the cool air from
the air conditioners. We also taught them about library etiquette and to
keep the library litter-free.</p>
<p>During the tour, I had to step out of my comfort zone to ensure the kindergarteners
have a good time. For example, I had to talk to a group of students while
trying to keep my words simple at the same time. I also learnt about effective
communication. Since student docents were leading different groups, we
had to communicate with one another where our stops were so that the area
was not crowded. Lastly, I learnt to be brave and try new things. This
valuable experience was really meaningful to me. If I had the opportunity
to do this again, I would not hesitate to say yes.</p>

<h4><strong><u>My Experience at the National School Games (Floorball)</u></strong></h4>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I have been
a member of the Fuhua Primary School Floorball Co-Curricular Activity (CCA)
since Primary 4. A year on, I was overjoyed when my CCA teachers-in-charge
(Ms Alicia Khong, Mdm Nurul Ain and Ms Shamira) announced that a group
of us would be chosen to represent our school for the National School Games
(Junior Division). This was the first time Fuhua Primary School would send
a Floorball team to compete in the National School Games. As one of the
eighteen members chosen, I felt very honoured and could not wait to put
my best foot forward in time to come.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Since Term 1 this year, we have had an extra day of training on Monday
afternoons, between 3 and 5 p.m. Towards the end of January, we were asked
to place orders for the competition jerseys. During the term break in March,
we came back to school to work on our techniques and explore various play
strategies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
On the 29<sup>th</sup> of April, our teachers arranged for us to play a
friendly game against the team from Fernvale Primary School, a school in
the North-East of Singapore. Fernvale Primary School was ranked a Tier
1 team when they played in the Games in 2023, which meant that it was a
strong team. Although we lost, it helped our team have a feel of how it
was like to play against players from another school and to learn from
them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Between the 6<sup>th</sup> of May and the 15<sup>th</sup> of July, we went
through what was known as the Pool Round, in which we played against schools
randomly placed in the same group (BC2) as us. They were Riverside Primary
School, Unity Primary School and Fern Green Primary School. We were ranked
&nbsp;second within this group, with Riverside Primary School taking the
lead.</p>
<p>From that Pool Round, we were classified in a Tier 3 group, as our school
is a school without prior experience at the Games for Floorball.&nbsp;
We were assigned to Group B3, where we would compete against Mee Toh Primary
School, Radin Mas Primary School and Canossa Catholic Primary School. These
matches took place between the 31<sup>st</sup> of July and the 16<sup>th</sup> of
August.</p>
<p>I was very privileged to have my mother and younger sister take time to
go to the various venues where the matches were held to support the team.
We had family members of a couple of my teammates come to watch a couple
of games too. They were cheering their hearts out as we chased after every
ball, guarded our goal posts and blocked every attempt made by the opponents
at scoring.</p>
<p>I recall feeling the jitters before every match and often felt that we
would never beat another school, especially one which had prior experience
at the Games. Often, our coach would be passionately shouting instructions
during the matches to spur us on and push us to keep fighting. At the end
of this 2024 season, we emerged victorious as the winner of Group B3!</p>
<p>I am truly thankful to be given the opportunity to experience competing
in the National School Games and slightly dismayed that I would not be
able to compete next year as we do not have enough players to make up a
team to enter ourselves in the Senior Division Games. I am grateful to
our teachers-in-charge for sacrificing their time to chaperone us. I will
always remember the friendships I forged with the members of this team.</p>
