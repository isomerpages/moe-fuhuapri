<p><strong><u>Kindergarten Tour Experience</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Recently, some P4 prefects had a chance to bring Kindergarten 2 (K2) students
from preschools in Jurong East around the school. We were privileged to
show them the school to have an experience as a life of a Primary 1 student.&nbsp;I
was very happy when I was given this task as I can contribute to the society
and help them overcome challenges when entering a new school.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the visit, I was assigned as a student docent to guide K2 students
around our school. Firstly, we gathered at the Tinker Lab, where we were
assigned to different groups. We introduced ourselves to the K2 students.
Then, we headed to the library where we showed them different genres of
books.</p>
<p>Next, we headed to the courtyard, where we told them the importance of
the lightning risk alert and that we have to be careful when playing. After
that, we went to the bookshop where the K2 students’ jaws dropped at the
sight of many interesting items to buy. We told them that they had to be
careful of what they bought as we do not want them to waste money.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Finally, we went to the canteen. We settled the kindergarteners
down at a table which was assigned to us and they put their water bottles
down. Then, we each took two or three K2 students and explained to them
what was sold at each store. They were in a dilemma as they could not decide
on what they should buy with the limited amount of money. After buying
their food, we sat down at the assigned table and chatted with them on
the things they will do or experience when they are in primary school.</p>
<p>I enjoyed the part about bringing the kindergarteners to the canteen to
buy food. The kindergarteners were the most excited when we brought them
to buy food.</p>
<p>If I had another chance, I would definitely agree to be a student docent
again as I felt a sense of accomplishment bringing the kindergarteners
around the school. From this new experience, I learnt that patience is
key to understand the younger ones. They might not understand the words
we used and they would ask questions. We have to be patient when answering
them and not brush them off. We have to treat others the way we want to
be treated.</p>

<p>During the kindergarten tour, my friends and I brought Kindergarten 2
(K2) students around the school as we explained to them the school rules.</p>
<p>When we brought the K2 students to the canteen, they had a chance to try
the food there. When we brought them to the bookshop, they were excited
after seeing the beautiful stationery and books. We also brought them to
other places such as the courtyard where we taught them about safety rules
while playing. Next, we went to the hall where we told them about our morning
assembly. Their favorite part of the tour was when we brought them to the
library. We saw them gasp in disbelief when they felt the cool air from
the air conditioners. We also taught them about library etiquette and to
keep the library litter-free.</p>
<p>During the tour, I had to step out of my comfort zone to ensure the kindergarteners
have a good time. For example, I had to talk to a group of students while
trying to keep my words simple at the same time. I also learnt about effective
communication. Since student docents were leading different groups, we
had to communicate with one another where our stops were so that the area
was not crowded. Lastly, I learnt to be brave and try new things. This
valuable experience was really meaningful to me. If I had the opportunity
to do this again, I would not hesitate to say yes.</p>
