<h4>Staff Learning Journey</h4>

<h4>Berita Harian Gen G Tiktok &amp; Video Competition</h4>
<p>In Term 1, the Malay Language Department sent two teams of P4 students
to participate in a video competition organised by local newspaper, Berita
Harian Gen G. The competition aims to foster a passion and love for the
Malay Language by re-enacting scenes inspired by the works of the late
Malay film icon, P Ramlee. Our Fuhua Gems were stellar in creating the
videos - from researching to memorising scripts and finally acting the
scenes out.</p>
<p>We are pleased to share that one of our teams, Fuhua Baba, won 2<sup>nd</sup> place!
Their video reiterates the significance of heritage and cultural identity
and personalised lyrics adapted from P Ramlee movies. Congratulations to
the team!</p>
<p>We look forward for more opportunities for Fuhua Gems to participate and
make Mother Tongue Languages come alive.</p>
